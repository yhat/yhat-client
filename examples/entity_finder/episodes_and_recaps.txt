In the hospital, Joan Moore is diagnosed as suffering from insulin shock, even though she is not a diabetic. On further investigation, Green and Briscoe find out that Joan is actually suffering from Parkinson's disease—and, unbeknownst to her husband, has been receiving treatment from Dr. Richard Shipman—and suspect that her husband is either attempting to kill her or helping her commit suicide.Trying to trace the source of the insulin, the detectives run into the psychiatrist Bertrand Stokes, who has previously smuggled that substance into the country. Stokes' wife, however, explains that the insulin is part of a sex game in which a number of men inject their wives with insulin, have intercourse with them, tape the entire event, and swap the tapes among each other. David Moore admits that this is indeed happening, but claims he kept it from the police in order to spare his wife the embarrassment. Because he is accused of murdering Joan, David loses custody of her (and her fortune) to Joan's daughter, Debbie Mann.On further investigation, it turns out that Joan's Parkinson's disease is not natural, but induced by the drug MPTP. Remnants of this drug are subsequently found in Debbie's office, and it turns out that her company is on the brink of bankruptcy and is only kept afloat by an infusion of Joan's money. Green and Briscoe find out that Debbie and Shipman, who previously did research on MPTP, know each other and get Debbie to confess that the two conspired to slowly poison Joan. However, Debbie claims she pulled out of the arrangement at the last minute and that Shipman administered the fatal dosage of MPTP on his own. With the threat of reviving Joan through the drug L-dopa, Shipman finally confesses that this scenario is indeed true.

Todd|11|original|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order/standoff-9736/recap|http://www.tv.com|A leader of an Hispanic gang is found murdered inside the prison where he is serving time. His murder is made to look like the result of a simple continuing gang struggle for control of his turf and the proceeds of a pending huge drug deal.  In reality, his murder is the result of the acts of the enraged lover of a female corrections officer who had been raped by the victim while she was a guard at another facility. It is basically a murder for hire since the actual act is performed by another, psychopathic inmate who is looking for favorable treatment for his son who just happens to be a chip off the old block, serving time in another prison.  As usual, Briscoe and Green go after the wrong suspects and end up with egg on their face.  McCoy takes on the corrections officers' union and makes no friends on this one. This blunder had to cost the city a fortune!

Since robbery doesn't appear to be the motive for the murder, Briscoe and Green delve deeper and discover that this was a murder for hire. A son of one of the partners in the business feared that his future as the ""king of leather"" in New York City was in jeopardy because the business was going to go to the partner's grandson instead. McCoy's prosecution is hampered when the accused's parents ship him to Israel in an effort to evade a guilty verdict in New York and to bolster their case for a trial and possible sentencing in Israel under the ""Right of Return"" law. Their efforts are thwarted when it's revealed that the accused was actually adopted, and therefore is not considered a Jew under Jewish law."

The arrest and prosecution of the former political radical, Lateef Miller, leads to racial clashes, on the street, in the police department and in the court-room. Detective Green is caught between loyalty to his brethren in the department and his ""brothers"" on the street.  The entire prosecution becomes an ugly political circus, dredging up faded but bitter memories of a time in America when the police were a little more overt with their racially motivated, crime-fighting activities and the ""enemies of the state"" were a little more clearly defined."

Detectives Briscoe's and Green's suspicions first fall on a homeless man who frequently stayed in the doorway, but that man tells them he was chased away the night of the murder by a group of teenagers, four boys and one girl—who had the key to the apartment.The detectives identify one of the girls as Heather, sister of the apartment's last resident. It turns out that she, her boyfriend Mitch, and their friends Peter, Chris, and Nick were partying there the night of the murder. Mitch is questioned first and, after several attempts at evasion, calls the death an accident and blames his friend Peter. However, further investigation, which uncovers a juvenile assault on Mitch's record, leads to the conclusion that it was he who first planned to rob the delivery man and then instigated and committed the murder. Mitch tries to plead guilty to murder one, but the DA's office after extensive deliberation decides to pursue the death penalty—from which his friends are exempt because they are under 18, which he turned two weeks previously.At the trial, only Mitch and his mother take the stand, suggesting that his anger is due to bad relationships with his father and stepfather. In the closing statements, McCoy asks the jury to consider the defendant's savagery and viciousness, while the defense attorney argues that Mitch should be spared because he will be a different person in twenty years. However, the jury passes a death penalty.

The man's partner, Donald Alvers, tells the detectives that the baby is prone to seizures (due to its mother's drug use during pregnancy) and needs to be found quickly. A ransom call comes in, but following the money after the drop-off leads only to dead ends: a messenger, a young man, and a mechanic who have participated by picking up the money, by accepting the ransom, and by making the ransom call-all without knowing about the kidnapping. As a matter of fact, it turns out the car mechanic was simply trying to take advantage of Alvers after finding out about the abduction.Now, the detectives follow the trail of the medication Dylan needs for his seizures. They find out that a prescription was called in and picked up by one Susan Powers. Raiding Powers' apartment, they discover that it is a safe house for battered women and learn that the kidnapped kid's birth mother, Celia Goddard, claiming to be an abused woman, has hidden the baby away. The detectives arrest Celia in a bus trying to leave town. Under intense interrogation, and to save herself from the accusation of murder, Celia finally admits that she was involved in the kidnapping. The detectives find Dylan with his biological father, Robert Kelley, in Peekskill and return him to Alvers.The district attorneys decide to cut a deal with Celia and charge Kelley with second-degree murder, motivated by bias -- Celia claims Kelley only became interested in getting Dylan back when he found out he had been adopted by a homosexual couple. In the trial, the main issue is whether Celia manipulated Kelley into murdering Mandell, or whether Kelley purposely killed him because he was gay. Kelley makes the death out to be an accident, but the medical examiner's report says that Mandell was beaten to death after he was unconscious. The jury finds Kelley guilty of the murder and of a hate crime.

When the two young men in the back car run away, the elderly couple in the front one find a young, pregnant, dying woman - Deena Meredith - in the trunk of the car. By tracing stolen car parts in the back of the car, the detectives locate the two young men, foreigners working for a chop shop dealer, but reject them as suspects for the actual murder.From Deena's credit card records, the detectives place her at a bar a few hours before her murder. Witnesses describe her leaving the bar with two young men in a champagne Lexus, and a midtown Lexus dealership - where cars cost the equivalent of an entire year's salary for a detective - places the car with the basketball star Chris Coty. He explains that his friend Henry Williams was driving the car. Loan reports concerning the financing of the car show that Deena was the loan officer in charge.As a matter of fact, Deena organized around $300,000 in loans that went to Williams for 'business investment,' probably drug deals, in Coty's name. Coty's team lawyer is aware of his dealings, and his own drug habit, and puts the police on the trail of one Marcus Cole, in whose apartment a semi-automatic .44 is found - the murder weapon. Cole tells the police that Coty instigated the murder, and Coty goes on the run. He is finally tracked down and arrested in his mother's home, where he is considering suicide.Under the threat of a life sentence with no possibility for parole, Williams divulges that Coty is the father of Deena's baby. While both Williams and Cole accuse the basketball star of having instigated the murder, Coty claims that Williams killed Deena because he (Coty) had cut him (Williams) off from his drug money. In court, the district attorneys argue that Coty had Deena killed in order to avoid paying child support, while the defense asserts that he is innocent and being hounded because he is a sports celebrity. The jury finds Coty guilty.

This man turns out to be innocent, but he gives the detectives the number of Jarrell's (stolen) cell phone, which leads them to a Mr. Daltry, who claims he was trying to purchase ecstasy from her and calls her an incompetent drug dealer. Daltry points the detectives to a drug dealer known as Taz, whose real name is Frances Partell.While the detectives can find nothing connecting Partell with Jarrell's murder, they discover from his former partner, Mr. Quintana, that he was involved in the murder of a bouncer at a club in the Bronx in 1998--for which another man, Tony Shaeffer, was sentenced after he boasted to his girl-friend of the murder. The detectives re-interview the witnesses of the bouncer murder and arrest Partell for it.Unfortunately, this arrest raises serious interoffice issues with the detectives, prosecutors, and DAs in the Bronx-the only reason the Manhattan office is allowed to prosecute the case in the first place is because the club is 488 yards from the county line. In spite of various witnesses raising doubts about the case, DA Robertson in the Bronx refuses to reconsider the case. The Manhattan DAs take the case to court nevertheless and manage to win an evidentiary hearing. Lewin asks McCoy and Carmichael to strike a deal with Partell in which he admits his guilt to get Shaeffer out of jail, but even after Partell's confession DA Robertson refuses to budge. McCoy takes the case to the Appellate Court and manages to win freedom for Shaeffer.

Fordes & Wendy Battles|11|original|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order/ego-31664/recap|http://www.tv.com|The corpse of a young woman who has been dead three or four weeks is fished out of the Hudson River. By tracing a belt buckle to a Manhattan gallery and with some phone canvassing, Briscoe and Greene identify the woman as Karen Hall, a woman working in the Office of the Attorney General in Albany who was been missing for several weeks. The proprietor of a newsstand at the Albany train station claims to have seen her the night of her disappearance, when she was returning from an assignment in New York. However, the Albany cops tell Briscoe and Green-off the record-that they believe the Attorney General's office steered the investigation in the wrong direction, away from their own office.The detectives follow up the last case Karen was involved in, baby-sitting a witness, and learn from that witness that Karen probably was involved with a man. One of her sisters confirms this suspicion. From credit card receipts, the detectives find out that she frequented a small restaurant in Manhattan, where the head waiter identifies her male companion as her fellow worker, Assistant Attorney General Alec Conroy.Because of Conroy's position as the heir apparent at the Attorney General's office, Manhattan DA Lewin is reluctant to pursue the case, especially since he has an alibi from a second mistress, Alice Murner, who completely idolizes him. Briscoe and Greene find out that his wife had tried to keep him from their apartment and kids, and they discover that the two went to therapy together. From the therapist, they learn that he sent a letter to Karen, Alice, and the wife warning them of immediate physical danger. They also locate a weapon on a boat belonging to Alice, and find out that Conroy took the boat out-carrying a large duffelbag-the night of Karen's disappearance. With this information, they arrest Conroy.Conroy's attorney Stan Gillum gets the letter from the therapist thrown out because of marriage privilege. The district attorney's office go ahead with the case anyway, but on cross-examination of Alice, the defendant's attorney makes it look like she committed the murder out of jealousy. At the same time, he lets slip that Conroy and his wife are legally separated, which McCoy uses to get the letter re-admitted as evidence. At that point, Conroy agrees to a plea that will put him in jail for 20 years and describes the murder to McCoy and Carmichael in detail.

The detectives find out that Alvarez was probably dealing cocaine, and through his nephew trace his movements to the heliport, where he met a flight coming from a military base carrying Karen Wyman, the wife of a major. The military don't exactly encourage the investigation, but the detectives find a connection between Alvarez and Caryn Wyman and arrest her for drug possession and conspiracy. Caryn first doesn't take the arrest very seriously, but eventually admits that she was bringing cocaine into the country for Alvarez, and that a man with a pony-tail was asking her to bring in even more drugs, showing her Alvarez's ear for additional motivation. Using Karen as bait, the police arrest Peña, the man with the ponytail. In the trial, however, two witnesses who had previously identified Peña recant, and the prosecutors have to rely on Caryn's testimony. Fortunately, the jury believes her and sends Peña to jail. Karen gets off with probation, and she and her husband are placed under witness protection.

The detectives find out that the man is Hector Santiago, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who works odd jobs around town. While he told his wife he was working renovating buildings, Hector was actually working for a moving company. However, his injury turns out to be the result of whiplash in a car accident.  Briscoe and Greene find a record of Hector being in a car accident and track down the other parties involved in the crash. Hector sat in a car with Chad Patel and Emerald Daley, and it is revealed that the three intentionally trapped an SUV into an accident for a fee of $200 per person. While Hector is dead and Chad flees, Emerald explains that the boss of the moving company, Bill Reed, set up the plan.Reed initially denies any involvement in the accidents, so the DAs follow the money involved in the transaction. They find out that the victims were all 'treated' by the same chiropractor, Jerome Raleigh, who made insurance claims without actually seeing his patients. Under pressure, both Reed and Raleigh tell the detectives that Raleigh's lawyers Petrie and Sanders organized the scam. The DAs succeed in separating Raleigh from his lawyers and arrest the two for murder.  In the trial, the defense attorney tries to paint Petrie and Sanders as a mixture of Cesar Chavez and Robin Hood, protecting the poor and innocent, but the prosecution calls in the widow of another victim of their scheme, Mrs. Ndabe, to discredit them. The strategy works, and the two lawyers are found guilty of murder.

A party across the hall gives them the opportunity to question several people as possible suspects, but none of them are the killer.  Following a red herring, they spend time tracking down one of the victim's drug (heroin) connections but to no avail.  Going back to square one, they decide the killer had access to the building because they couldn't find anyone who buzzed him or her in before the murders.During the re-canvassing they discover a tenant saw a workman leaving the building.  Adding this question to their canvassing, they come up with another red herring but zone in on the workman's clothing.  This leads them to a locksmith business with access to the building and to the locks.  Upon future questioning Briscoe and Green decide to look deeper into the locksmith's nephew.Going to the suspect's apartment, they discover he lives with his mother.  After talking their way into his room, they find newspaper clippings of recent crimes, which gravely concerns them.  Tracking the nephew down at a nearby pharmacy proves today is not our hero's day.  A routine pick-up turns into a hostage situation and the basis for the courtroom side of the show. The nephew requests a lawyer (as in one will be appointed for you).  Assistant District Attorney Southerlyn decides this is her opportunity to assist and to obtain a confession.  She tells the suspect she is a lawyer and shows her bar membership card.  She specifically avoids showing her D.A. badge.  Thinking he is talking to his lawyer instead of the city's lawyer, he confesses.  She talks him into freeing the hostage and giving up by implying she will get him a good deal.The nephew's real lawyer discovers from his client that Ms. Southerlyn is his legal representative.  The new lawyer attempts to have the confession thrown out because it should be a privileged communication between a lawyer and a client, even if the lawyer is a DA.  The Judge finds the confession admissible because the hostage was a third party, which negated the client-lawyer privilege. The nephew's lawyer failed to make a case that Ms. Southerlyn's representation was ineffective as she failed to inform him a third party would negate the client-lawyer privilege and hence the confession was still inadmissible.McCoy negotiates the crimes to murder two, instead of murder one because of this plot twist.The New York Disciplinary Committee receives a complaint from the nephew and his lawyer about Ms. Southerlyn's behavior and says she violated section DR 1-102 of the New York Bar Associations Rules and Ethics.  McCoy represents her, as no private attorney will take the case, at the hearing.  In the meantime their boss suspends her pending the results of the hearing.  Facing disbarment Ms. Southerlyn must face the day and her decision over again.  McCoy's argues the ends justify the means and the court should allow district attorneys the same rights to lie as the police got from the courts.  The panel rules against Ms. Southerlyn and Mr. McCoy saying the ends can never ever justify the means.  Society must have the ethics of lawyers and the court to protect them from anarchy and nothing justifies the breaking the code of ethics.  Clearly, Ms. Southerlyn actions saved the hostage but her obtaining the confession went too far.  The panel finds her guilty of violating section D 1-102 but does not disbar her.  They recommend to the appeals court she receives a private letter of reprimand.  Her boss reinstates her to the court calendar, as the show ends.

The medical examiner determines that though the victim did fall down the stairs, being hit in the head with a golf club is what killed him. Briscoe and Green meet with the woman he was supposed to meet up with the day he was killed, and are led to a store that sells high-priced women's clothing. From there they meet two women; the first has a solid alibi, and the second is Lindsay, a photographer who is also the victim's girlfriend. Lindsay claims she was at a photo shoot with cosmetics mogul Jackie Scott, which is confirmed by Jackie. Upon a review of the victim's client list, A.D.A. Serena discovers that Jackie Scott is Lindsay's mother and that both of them were sleeping with the victim. Briscoe and Green talk to Lindsay's nanny, which leads them to a picture that Lindsay took of a marathon the day the victim was killed proving that she was not at the photoshoot at all. Briscoe and Green confront Jackie with this fact, and Jackie confirms that she was having an affair with her daughter's boyfriend when Lindsay appears. Lindsay then recants her story and said that the only reason she said that was because she knew her mom would be at her office and when Briscoe and Green ask if she killed the victim because he was sleeping with her mother, Lindsay says she didn't know anything about an affair. Briscoe and Green return to Jackie's office to ask her where she really was when Jackie storms in with cards that had accidently been delivered to her, revealing to Lindsay that her mother was sleeping with the victim/her boyfriend. Lindsay then burst outs saying that she was the one who killed the victim.Later, Jackie meets with D.A. Arthur and asks him to forget the case because they're old friends, but Arthur refuses. Back at the DA's office Arthur says that he's suspicious of Jackie and has Serena look into Jackie and why she would have killed the victim. When Serena reviews Jackie's stocks, she discovers that Jackie sold all of her stock in one company days before the company's stocks fell, revealing that Jackie had inside information. Further research into the matter reveals that Jackie could only sell certain stocks if the victim allowed her to, i.e. her motive for killing the vicitim.In order to get condemning evidence on Jackie, Arthur has Lindsay released but has her phone wiretapped, which provides them with the evidence they need. At arraignment, Jackie is put under house arrest, is forced to wear a tracking device and loses her passport. Lindsay comes to Arthur's office and begs him to help Jackie, but Arthur refuses. Jackie's lawyer asks that Jackie be given an evaluation to see if hormone replacement therapy withdrawal could have caused her to kill the victim, and is evaluated by Dr. Emil Skoda and Dr. Elizabeth Olivet. After the evaluation is over, McCoy decides to use Dr. Olivet as a witness and not Dr. Skoda.At trial, Jack McCoy asks Dr. Olivet if Jackie's hormone problems could trigger her to kill and Olivet says no. Jackie's lawyer tries to make Olivet seem unqualifed, and asks if she has the right education to make an evaluation. Then to McCoy's surprise, Dr. Skoda is called by the defense, and discovers that they forgot to take him off their witness list. The defense asks Dr. Skoda if sleep deprived people are more likely to kill or cause acts of violence, to which Skoda says that the sleep deprived are more likely to attack someone. McCoy then asks Dr. Skoda if being sleep deprived would cause someone to kill, to which Dr. Skoda says no. Jackie is finally put on the stand and says she has no memory of killing the victim. McCoy asks if she remembered how she got there and how she got home, and Jackie says she does and that she even remembers tipping the cab driver. McCoy says that it's ironic that she would remember tipping the cab, but not killing the victim.Later, Arthur offers Jackie a deal, Manslaughter One, but Jackie doesn't take it. However, when Arthur reveals that he'd like to cross-examine her himself, asking about every little thing, Jackie caves and takes the deal.

Fontana and Falco arrive and they ask witnesses, but no one knows anything. One witness says he saw someone outside, and, while he can't give a description, he says the man was wearing a jacket with a triangle on the back.At the morgue, Fontana thinks the man is jockey.So Fontana and Falco go to the track. They learn his name is Oscar Salazar and that he's from Panama. Everyone says he's impulsive. They think that he may have been having a dispute with Cass Holloman, one of the trainers, who may have been doing something illegal to win. When they confront the trainer, he has an alibi. Later they learn he was supposed to ride a horse that some say has potential, but Cass Holloman says he did no such thing. They also discover he wears a jacket that has a ""V"" logo on the bag which could be mistaken for a triangle. They later learn from another jockey that Holloman asked Salazar to meet him at the bar. When they question him, he says he wasn't the one who saw Salazar, it was the owner Edgar Varick. They ask him what this is all about. He says that it's about Varick's horse, Rasputin. Salazar, who once rode him, thought he was a winner and if he rode him, it could make his career. But Varick wouldn't allow it. So Salazar started inquiring about Rasputin's blood line. It seems like Varick claims he paid around $30,000 for Rasputin, but Holloman thinks he's worth at least a 100 times that. They arrest Varick.Later, McCoy wonders why Varick is so antsy about the horse. So he has Alex check out Varick's finances and discovers Varick has not moved any money. She wonders if maybe he got money for the purchase from his family. She talks to his mother who says she's the sole owner of the company, and all he gets is a salary. She says that once in a while he has her sign papers for the company pension fund. Alex also learns that Varick actually paid $3 million for the horse.Alex determines Varick stole from the company's pension fund when they gave him permission to move the pension fund to a mutual fund, which allowed him to access it. The company foreman, who's also a trustee of the pension fund, is upset to learn of this.At the trial, the foreman blows up in court, jeopardizing the case. Later, Varick doesn't show up in court. So the judge issues a bench warrant for his arrest. When he doesn't turn up, McCoy decides to repossess everything he owns—including Rasputin—to restore the company's pension fund. Later, Varick's car is found at the airport and taken to impound. When they do an inventory search, they find Varick in the trunk dead, shot in the head."

The husband and father of the victims, Frank Andreas, is not present, and so Detectives Green and Fontana search for him at his store. They find, however, the store has been shut down and Andreas has been arrested for selling official NYPD equipment that has fallen off the back of a truck, as well as counterfeit badges.As it happens, ADA Borgia was the prosecutor for Andreas' case, and she tells the detectives that he was able to give her information which linked his suppliers to the unsolved murder of 3 people.Borgia convinces Andreas' lawyer to make contact with him so the detectives can speak to him. When Andreas is brought in to the station, he receives his wife's personal effects and notices that her engagement ring is missing. He also reveals that his wife called him several times to tell him to come home, but that he suspected something was wrong so he stayed away. Andreas names his contacts as two men named Ricky and Vincent, and says that he was able to make counterfeit DEA badges based on a real DEA badge that they had brought him to work off, although he didn't know who the real badge belonged to. Fearful for his life, he refuses to give anymore information.Borgia speaks to McCoy and insists that she wants to maintain control of the case. She returns home to her apartment late at night and is on the phone to the DEA, who are giving her the runaround. There is a knock at the door, and she barely has a chance to open it before it is knocked down by two men who storm into her apartment, gag her with duct tape and drag her away.McCoy and Van Buren interrogate Andreas for any information he might have that he hasn't given them yet, certain that Borgia's disappearance has something to do with the case. Threatened with being dumped into jail, rather than protective custody, he gives up the name of his contact, Dave Morley, who might know the identities of Ricky and Vincent. As McCoy is leaving, Andreas makes the suggestion that Borgia might be dirty.The detectives try to find Morley, but he has skipped town. In the meantime, Van Buren discovers that $8000 was deposited into Borgia's account, the day before Andreas left jail. Just to cover their bases, she sends Green and Fontana to the bank to investigate, and the teller they speak to reveals that the computer has recorded that a teller at a branch where Borgia did not regularly bank had accessed her account.Green and Fontana talk to the teller who accessed Borgia's account details, and he admits that he was coerced to do so to try and get his brother out of trouble with the DEA. He says that a DEA agent named Almonte had told him to do it.The detectives talk to Almonte, but he won't admit anything. The detectives are sure, though, that he is somehow involved, and so McCoy cooks up a minor computer trespass charge against him and Almonte is arrested. A fruitless interrogation session with Almonte is interrupted when Van Buren receives word that an abandoned car has been found. She, Green, Fontana and McCoy all go to the scene, and find that Borgia's badly beaten body is in the trunk of the car. The medical examiner says that she suffocated after throwing up into her gag from the severe beating she endured.McCoy goes to talk to Andreas, who is still in protective custody, and begins to cook up a scheme to flip Almonte, with Andreas' cooperation. He convinces a friendly judge to stage a simulated prosecution, which involves holding a grand jury with fictional testimony, and a sham murder indictment of Almonte for the 3 murders which Andreas originally attributed to Ricky and Vincent and their associates. (According to McCoy, such a ruse is perfectly legal and has precedence in at least one other case).Andreas testifies in the mock grand jury, lying that Ricky and Vincent told him that the DEA badge belonged to Almonte, when in fact he had no such knowledge. This secures a pretend indictment, and McCoy then tries to negotiate with Almonte for a lesser sentence, if he will admit to involvement in Borgia and Andreas' murders. Almonte, however, smells desperation and calls Jack's bluff. He refuses to deal.Meanwhile, Green and Fontana have managed to track down Mrs. Andreas' stolen engagement ring, which had been pawned. They raid the apartment of the woman who pawned it, only to find out that they had just missed Ricky and Vincent and no one knows where they went.  McCoy arranges for Almonte to be 'slipped' a tapped cell phone while in prison, which then records a conversation with Vincent, in which he tries to arrange the murder of the grand jury witness against him (Andreas).The supervising judge (who is trying to make sure that all the pretending stays above board) tells McCoy that she cannot allow a real indictment based on the taped phone conversation because it is entrapment. There is no choice, then, but to let Almonte walk free.As Almonte leaves jail, he is followed and monitored by Van Buren and the other detectives. Before they have a chance to step in, Almonte is murdered outside his apartment in a drive-by shooting. Green and Fontana manage to stop the car and arrest Ricky and Vincent.Ricky and Vincent are indicted on nine counts of murder. McCoy handles the arraignment, but is stopped midway when the Assistant State's Attorney-General enters the courtroom and says that he has Governor's orders to handle the case as a special prosecutor, as McCoy is far too emotionally involved in the case to be able to conduct the prosecution. McCoy, therefore, is forced to step down from the case.

After talking to the company owner, Jason Rundberg, they get a name for the user, REwind99. They question the husband and daughter, which leads them to Bill Walker, a former lover. He hasn't seen Caroline in months. Their investigation leads them to a lingerie shop, where they finally get a lead on REwind99 -- he turns out to be a paranoid schizophrenic named Richard Elam. In the meanwhile, Molly Preston turns up missing. After speaking with Elam's mother, they manage to track Elam to a motel with the help of an Amber Alert that had been put out on Molly. They arrest Elam, who screams about being Molly's savior as he is being arrested, and Cassady comforts a hysterical Molly who says that Elam raped her.After Elam's arraigment, his attorney wants to talk to Rubirosa. He provides information to her showing that Elam was coerced into the killing by Molly herself, who had used her B-Frendz.com website to complain about her mother all the time, claiming her mother horribly abused her. After checking out the website itself and proving what Elam is saying, Green and Cassady go to Molly's school and arrest her.Molly insists she is innocent of any wrong-doing, and her father insists that anything she may have done she did because of the website. Although Rubirosa is convinced that Molly is fully aware of the consequences of her actions, McCoy isn't so sure the jury will agree. When Stewart brings Jason Rundberg on the stand and accuses him (as owner of B-Frendz.com) of being responsible for the murder because he had received complaints about Molly's site, McCoy and Rubirosa learn that she only introduced three of the four e-mails received into evidence. Researching the fourth e-mail leads them to university football player Gregg Robinson. Robinson is unwilling to talk, but Rundberg hands over the full e-mail.Robinson takes the stand at Molly's trial, where he states that he IM'd her after seeing her blog posting where she offered her body to anyone who would kill her mother. He stated he had sex with her, never assuming she was serious, and then after realising she was e-mailed the site. McCoy and Rubirosa again offered Molly a deal, ten years, which her father tried to get her to accept but she refused.When the verdict came in, Molly Preston was convicted of second degree murder.

McCoy, however, is able to politically wrangle a community leader to help generate leads which get the shooter. The shooter claims that he opened fire on the teenage boy because he was swinging a baseball bat at his son and that the pre-teen girl's death was an accident. Investigating this claim, police and the DA uncover the fact that the teen did indeed have a bat and that he was actually incited and driven to the fight by his somewhat-racist mother in order to retrieve a basketball stolen by the shooter's son. Cutter prosecutes the shooter and the mother as unhappy co-defendents, one for 2 counts murder, the other for 2 counts reckless endangerment manslaughter.

Greg says he will help her but she declines.A police officer and Detective Kevin Bernard walk into the faculty parking lot and find a body. He took two shots in the chest and all he has on him is a wad of cash and dormitory key card. He appears to be a business major.They try to get video footage from the security card but the cameras are out of service. They slide the key card and the ID belongs to Hayley Koslow. They find Hayley and she tells them that Greg Tanner was crashing at her place. She said he wasn't a student but was mature and nice and had a sister at the university. She tells them he was in the military and got in a fight with a Hispanic guy a few nights before.They discover that the gun was fired at least three feet away. Lt. Anita Van Buren tells them that Megan, Greg's sister, is downstairs. They found out that the guy Greg was having a fight with is named Manny Lopez. Van Buren talks to Megan and she is very upset, saying that she saw Greg two days before when he offered to help her with her financial aid. He lived on campus because he had no where else to go. Their mother has Parkinson's disease and their father died when he was 10, which made him join the service to be like his dad. He had come back a different person, he was anxious all the time and was having trouble receiving army benefits. She explained that he had told her he would help her because he was ""into something big.""They think that this ""something big"" could have been a drug deal and Manny, the competition, got angry, following him into the faculty garage. But they also find that he could have been meeting a client, a professor, Kevin Franklin, who broke his pattern of coming into the garage. That day he came in at 1:00pm and didn't leave until noon the next day.They find Kevin Franklin who explains that he wasn't in the garage that day and that Greg looked vaguely familiar. He didn't take his car out because after he got out of his last class he went to the book store but by the time he got to the garage, the police had sealed it off, forcing him to take a cab and the metro home.They go to the bookstore and find out that the bookstore is always dead after dinner time and that Franklin had been arrested last year on a CPW.They look into it and find that Franklin was in a fender bender and pulled a weapon, only to find out that he had a permit for it in New York, it was a .22 caliber, same kind of gun that killed Tanner.Lupo goes to ADA Connie Rubirosa and tells her that Franklin's alibi doesn't make sense and that Tanner could have been performing blackmail using the pot that was found in his pocket. If that was found on Franklin, he would lose his teaching job and his law credentials. Rubirosa doesn't seem to think it all matches up and tells him to call her when they have some PC. Van Buren says they need to find ties between Tanner and Franklin, evidence that they had it out for each other.They go back to Hayley's and find a number of law books that belonged to Greg and a folder with Franklin's course syllabus in it and a recorder with Tanner asking Franklin about the Veterans Administration but Franklin doesn't want to talk.Lupo goes to Linden V.A. Hospital and finds that Tanner had received counseling for 30 days and then was discharged due to his benefits lapsing. He had been discharged from Abu Ghraib for having a pre-existing personality disorder and it was keeping him up at night. They go back to 2-7 and decide that Tanner was putting together a case to sue the Veteran's Administration and wanted Franklin to represent him.Van Buren comes in to announce that she was diagnosed with cancer and will be coming and going more than usual but she knows that everyone can put up with it. They report what they have found and she tells them to talk to Franklin's colleagues. Everyone is surprised at her announcement.They go to see Michael Gendel who tells them that Franklin probably wasn't involved and that he is up for tenure and is very competitive. There are some papers from the Bush administration that had just become declassified that Franklin contributed to.They go through declassified documents to find that Franklin wrote up the working conditions for guards like Tanner at Abu Ghraib and Gitmo and thinks Tanner may have blamed him, wanting money from him to make up for his post-traumatic stress. They find this as probable cause.Lupo and Bernard head to the DA's office for the warrant but they find that Franklin is already there, having confessed to Tanner's shooting. He had a stalker and saw him in the hallway in the parking garage and was saying that it was self-defense. Granick, Franklin's attorney, is surprised they want a plea, telling them that he shot a trained killer who blamed him for his mental problems, demanded money, and threatened him when he said no. Franklin hands over a prohibition, stating that they can't repeat anything that he said in the interview with the police.DA Jack Mc Coy goes over the paperwork and finds that self-defense is Franklin's only excuse. They receive a motion from Franklin addressing his write to address to Grand Jury. Franklin is trying to make himself look as good and innocent as possible. They decide they have got to make Tanner look as cute and cuddly as a week-old puppy.Megan testifies in court, saying that Greg was likable and suffered from PTSD. Franklin testifies about Tanner wanting help from Franklin because he was involved with the Bush Administration. He explains that Tanner had demanded money and when he followed him into the garage, Franklin got scared for his life and shot Tanner. He had been in such shock that he couldn't approach the police until 4 days after the shooting.They are questioning Megan's testimony because at first she said that Greg never spoke about his experiences. Megan explains that she had found a video diary that he had created on his computer. They watch it and look more into the memo that Franklin helped write for the Bush administration and decide that they must prosecute for allowing the torture of inmates by soldiers. They meet with the judge regarding conspiracy and she denies the motion. And they need co-conspirators.Mc Coy asks Cutter to read the entirety of Franklin's memo and to find his advice to anyone charged with torture.Cutter connects the dots with Franklin's memo. A goverment attorney comes into Mc Coy's office and threatens him, placing multiple books on the table that will help their case, warning him that they can keep making more and more if he wants to continue.Mc Coy decides to center in on Franklin, if they can prove that he broke the law, then they can start moving up the chain of command. Cutter complains, saying they may have gotten in too deep but Mc Coy won't stand down, saying these people are getting away with so many things during the war and it needs to stop. In the court room, Cutter goes over Franklin's memo, talking about how torture tactics don't work.David, a man from the attorney general's office, approaches Mc Coy trying to call the whole case off. Mc Coy shoots him down, telling him that they will not stop the case.Franklin is on the stand, telling them that he was asked to provide research and compile a memo regarding the success rate of torture. He states that many of the US Amendments do not apply on foreign soil. Cutter interrogates him and his stance on foreign torture.Jack goes into Cutter's office and hears that a state senator has requested that McCoy be removed as DA. McCoy says they are wanted in Federal Court tomorrow.McCoy goes to court and David is trying to call off the case stating that state law has no place in a federal case. The judge decides to look over the motion and in the meantime, the case can continue.Back in the courtroom, they are saying that Franklin didn't commit torture, he only wrote about it, therefore not committing a crime.Cutter retorts by saying that he wrote instructions on how to perform the crime and that these people were written in as a special class of prisoners that needed this kind of attention. Back in Supreme Court, the verdict arrives but a federal marshal arrives with an order from the district court. They have to stop the case. McCoy is still wanted out but he isn't worried, he is happy with the stab they took at this one."

Lupo and Bernard are called in to investigate. Jim was out of town the weekend of the murder. He was at his parents' house but has no alibi since they weren't at home. It's discovered that Daisy's wallet is missing, and Jim states that Daisy had a gift card to Victoria's Secret as his wedding gift to her and one credit card.Meanwhile, Lt. Van Buren is at the doctor's to discuss her cervical cancer. It's stage 2, which usually can be treated with chemotherapy. She was infected from HPV, which is a sexually transmitted disease, and since it takes more than a month for the cancer to appear, it looks as if it was her ex's fault.A suspicious ATM withdrawal pops up on Daisy's account, happening when she was at work. When it seems that she was getting antsy about the wedding (and feared that her fiance was having an affair because she found a feminine hygiene wipe in the trash which wasn't hers), Jim is brought in for questioning. He says that Daisy told him to take the money, and the detectives are suspicious, thinking they have him. However, a similar attack has come up in the 4th precinct.The victim, Emma Kim, says that she barely escaped her attacker, who seemed to have the same MO as Daisy's murderer. Emma is also Asian, also was attacked by a knife, and was also in a livery right before she was attacked. Emma suspects that her attacker has a thing for Asian women. Lupo doesn't think that Emma is safe in her apartment since her attacker knows where she lives, and that she should stay at the precinct instead.The detectives search for the driver based on Emma's description of him and of the Tweety decal on the back of his car. The driver denies that Emma ever rode in his car. They impound the man's car based on a charge of unpaid traffic tickets. Later in interrogation, the driver still insists that he didn't do anything to Emma and requests a lawyer, but Daisy's blood has been found in his car. In a police line up, Emma (while holding Lupo's hand), identifies the driver as her attacker. Lupo then offers to accompany Emma home.Bernard calls Lupo on his growing infatuation with Emma, saying that his personal feelings will start to mess up the case. The suggestion comes true when, during the hearing, Marquez points out that Emma and Lupo were holding hands when she IDed the driver. This could have meant that Lupo sent a secret signal to her about which suspect to point out. The line up evidence is thrown out because it could have been tainted. Later, Lupo and Emma spend the evening together, but Lupo becomes suspicious when he finds a piece of Victoria's Secret lingerie in Emma's closet.Jim is back to being questioned, and it's discovered that he and Emma worked for the same magazine. Jim breaks down and says that Emma asked him for money for her kidney medications. He took money out of Daisy's account to pay for them. After he confronted Emma about the money and told her that she would have to repay him, Jim went to his parents' house to cool off. Emma told him that he shouldn't mention anything about the money, and that she would get the detectives from investigating further. Lupo suddenly realizes what Emma meant by that.The detectives debrief Van Buren and she says to bring Jim in for larceny and obstruction of justice. When she asks about the lingerie, Lupo says that it's still in Emma's closet. And when pushed about how he knew that it was there, he admits to seeing it in her closet. Van Buren calls him on getting too personal with a witness. Lupo is suspended, and he rushes back to Emma to tell her what happened. However, Lupo is also wired, and Bernard and Van Buren are listening in on the conversation. Lupo attempts to push Emma but she keeps insisting that she was never with Jim. Emma is taken in for obstruction of justice.Emma blames Jim for the whole thing, saying that he was completely infatuated with her, but she told him that she wouldn't want to sleep with him while he was still engaged. Then he offered to pay her medical bills instead. The only thing that links the livery driver to the crime is the sample of Daisy's blood in his car, but it turns out that one of the CSIs working the scene took a blood sample from Daisy in order to frame the driver. The wipe which Daisy found suggests that Jim wasn't being faithful to her. Testing the wipe is positive for Emma's DNA as well as Jim's. Also, the sample reveals that Emma doesn't have the kidney disease she claims to have.Emma has conned several men out of thousands of dollars by saying she has various diseases. Daisy had been trying to track down Emma after Jim took out all that money, which was motive enough for Emma to kill her. Later on the stand, Emma claims that Lupo was pressuring her to sleep with him. Cutter, however, brings in all the testimony from the other men she conned. Emma tries to say that the judge had offered his help, so that this would force a mistrial, but then Cutter points out that even if there was a mistrial, she might do the exact same thing over again. Emma then tries to turn on Cutter, but Cutter refuses to break. The jury finds her guilty, and even as she's being taken away, she starts up a conversation with one of the guards, while Lupo looks on from a distance.

But instead, he finds Joy's lifeless body on the floor.Bernard and Lupo are called in to investigate. Joy was killed by blunt trauma force to her head, and the murder weapon could be a Special Olympics trophy. Larry explains that he was out to pick up the kids from day care. The Johnsons started adopting once they figured out that they couldn't get pregnant, and they now have ten children in their care. A Hispanic woman was spotted leaving the house before Joy's death.The Johnsons' oldest son, Tim, who's autistic was sent home early from school and spotted his mom on the floor. Blood got on his hands when he tried to check whether his mom was still alive. Tim is taken in for questioning. He claims to have not called the police first because on television, the suspect is always someone who is found close to the body. Bernard points out that not calling the police could also be a clue that the person is guilty, and Tim says that he'd hadn't thought of that.As they watch the interrogation, Van Buren speaks with Larry, and Larry points out that Tim wants to be a detective when he grows up. Tim would not suddenly snap and become violent. Tim explains that he left school earlier because he was being bullied. The detectives press on with Tim, wondering how he got into the house, and he says that he has a key. The questioning becomes a little too severe and then Tim confesses that he killed his mom. Van Buren then tries to talk with Tim, who eventually says that a boy from school (DJ Lovell) stole his fanny pack, and his house key was in that bag. DJ already has a record for theft and petty assault.Lupo and Bernard go talk to the Lovells, and DJ eventually says that he just threw the pack into the trash. DJ's mom mentions that she was over at the Johnsons' home earlier, and she saw Joy arguing with someone over the phone. Bernard has pulled the Johnsons' phone records and there were three calls on the day of Joy's death: from the school, from the Fraternal Order of Police, and from a woman named Belinda Alvarez, who might be the Hispanic woman the neighbor saw leaving earlier.Belinda has ten kids too, septuplets and three others. She seems very media-savvy and explains that she and the Johnsons were both vying for a spot on a reality show. Joy told her that she didn't want to do the show, and just about gave up the show for Belinda. That made her jump around happily, which was what the neighbor saw.The detectives return to the Johnson home to find that a reality TV crew has already started to film. They're asked to sign a release to be on the show, but they refuse to add their signatures to anything. Larry has apparently signed the contract to do the show. Joy was a hold-out, and as long as they were married, the reality TV company would have needed her signature on the contract in order to start the show. Now that Joy is dead, they only needed Larry's go-ahead. Larry claims that Joy wanted to do the show.Van Buren is busy taking a look at her insurance coverage, and worries that with the cost of chemo her lifetime cap will be reached in three months. So if she's cured in three months' time, then everything will be okay. Otherwise, she can give the detectives a really great deal on a used Toyota. The detectives go to speak to the producer of the show.The producer (Artie Cramer) says that he always knew Larry was willing to do the show, however Joy had misgivings. Larry was apparently holding out for more money. Larry is a real estate developer, so Lupo and Bernard go to his office, and they speak with his female accountant. Things have been slow at the company and a lot of staff have been laid off already. She and Larry have been going through the books, but she says that Larry wasn't in the office in the afternoon when Joy was murdered. Meanwhile, Larry's sister has flown in to help him with the kids.The detectives find out that Larry was having an affair with their nanny, Suzanne. Suzanne admits that Larry was at her apartment that day and stayed until it was time to pick up the kids. Bernard discovers that there is a man's shirt in the laundry hamper. Suzanne claims it's Larry's, and that he always changes clothes before leaving the apartment. The shirt has bloodstains on it.Larry explains that in the morning of Joy's death, one of the kids lashed out and cut Joy. That was probably where the blood came from. ADA Rubirosa and Van Buren go through the details of the case, but there's no hard evidence to convict Larry of the murder. Lupo mentions that Suzanne went through the kids' daily routine. When the kids come home from day care, they get out of the car immediately and run into the house. However, on the day of Joy's death, Larry told the kids to stay in the car while he went to get their mom. It looks as if Larry wanted to keep the kids from seeing their mom dead, which meant that he knew what had happened to her beforehand. Rubirosa thinks that this is enough proof to arrest him if they can corroborate the story with the kids.The detectives are back at the Johnsons, and they try to talk to the kids about that day, but they're having a hard time communicating. Tim comes in to help and the kids mention that their dad told them to stay in the car. This is confirmation enough and they end up arresting Larry while the reality show cameras are rolling.DA McCoy, EADA Cutter, and Rubirosa watch footage of Larry's arrest. Rubirosa admits that Children's Services will take the kids away from Larry if he can't make bail, so McCoy says to drop the bail to $100k, with the condition that Larry Johnson stop appearing on TV.Rubirosa is approached by the reality show producer, and they turn out to have gone to the same university. The producer suggests that they take the case to the court of public opinion. In exchange for Rubirosa appearing on the show and allowing them to tape footage of the trial, he offers tapes of interviews with Joy and Larry, with Joy expressing her misgivings about going on TV. Cutter and McCoy agree that getting the tapes would be beneficial to their case, and Rubirosa agrees to be on-camera.In court, Cutter explains that Larry's failed business dealings have made him desperate for cash. When he realized that Joy wouldn't agree to do the show, he snapped and killed her. Larry's defense lawyer argues that there is no evidence that Larry killed Joy. Belinda and DJ had motive and opportunity, and Tim actually did confess to the crime. So no one can prove who killed Joy.Rubirosa brings in the tapes of Joy showing her concern about being on camera all the time and what this will do to the children. McCoy says that she didn't actually say that she didn't want to do the show. But Rubirosa points out that there was a witness that Joy said that to.In court, Belinda is on the stand, and she repeats what she told the detectives. Joy told her that as far as she was concerned, Belinda could have the reality show all to herself. However, Larry's lawyer argues that Joy might have said it to make Belinda leave and that Belinda herself said that she would kill to be on the show, which is evidenced by a taped interview.Next on the stand is the producer, who admits that he doesn't think Belinda said that statement literally. He also says that he didn't think Joy seemed too eager to be on the show, and that he mainly dealt with Larry when it came to negotiating. He did tell Larry the day before Joy's death that the contract needed to be signed or else he'd take the show to someone else. The producer also says that Larry's accountant called him and ""he"" asked about payment. However, Rubirosa says that when the detectives spoke to Larry's accountant, it was a woman, not a man. Afterwards, Rubirosa tries to talk to the producer, who still has cameras on him.Later, Rubirosa says that the callback number the accountant gave the producer is actually a finance company which fronts for a loan shark named Sammy Shiner. Larry must have owed a lot of money, which was why Shiner was checking up on any cash coming Larry's way. If they can find Shiner and get him to testify, then they could convict Larry. If Larry says he didn't do it for the money and doesn't need it, they could bring Shiner in to rebut.Larry takes the stand, and he claims that he and Joy both agreed to do the show. On the day of her death, he says that the regular routine was broken up because Joy was tired and she went to take a nap, and Larry didn't want any of the kids to wake her up. He says point blank that he did not kill his wife.Cutter cross-examines Larry and brings up his affair, but everything else in the timeframe seems rock-solid. Larry stopped by to get coffee in between leaving his office, going to Suzanne's, and then going to pick up the kids. Once he says he didn't need the money, Cutter asks Rubirosa to get Shiner in as a material witness. However, Shiner appears to be out of the country at the moment. Wondering how the defense got tipped to their plan, Rubirosa realizes that she had her notepad open and exposed to the cameras the whole time. Anyone could have read her notes from the taped footage.Without the witness, Cutter goes through with bringing up Larry's arrangement with Shiner anyway, but Larry denies knowing the man and claims that his dealing with Uptown Finance was above the board and legitimate. Cutter mentions that sometimes Shiner's clients end up dead if they don't pay, which leads the defense to request that Shiner be brought in. The jury is deadlocked and the judge declares a mistrial.They're still in the middle of searching for Shiner when Cutter mentions to the rest of the attorneys that the production company switched up ""Larry Plus 10"" a little bit. Now Larry and his kids are moving in with Belinda and her kids in a large mansion, where they'll compete to win prizes. A human lie detector is also going to move in with them, so that maybe the public will find out the truth about who killed Joy. The audience will get to vote on whether Larry is guilty of the crime. And Cutter jokes that they asked Arthur Branch to be the judge."

Lupo and Bernard are put on the case. First, they speak to the doctor's wife, who says that she pleaded with her husband to stop performing abortions but that he claimed he was doing God's work anyway. Later, at the women's clinic, they speak to a security guard who is marking off tires with chalk. He says that since the right-to-life protestors keep taking up their parking spots, he has to enforce the two hour limit on cars. A nurse at the clinic worries that with the doctor dead, they might have to close down. The detectives note a list of messages from a man named Jonah Leland, who seemed very upset about something. His girlfriend was going to come in for an appointment tomorrow.Meanwhile Van Buren receives the bad news that her chemotherapy isn't helping to shrink her tumor. She can take other, stronger drugs, but the side effects would be worse than what she's experiencing now. Van Buren decides to go through with the stronger chemo.Leland tells the detectives that he never called Benning's office because that would have made his girlfriend angry. The baby has a genetic disorder but he doesn't have insurance to cover the medical care the baby would need once he was born. He and his girlfriend Blair broke up, and she said she was going to have the abortion because she couldn't take care of the baby. Afterwards, Lupo and Bernard argue their sides of the abortion debate. Bernard reveals that he was born premature because his mother threw herself down a flight of stairs in an attempt to get rid of her baby.Blair says that her baby would have a genetic skin disorder which would cause the skin to tear at the slightest touch. That would mean that he would need 24 hour medical care, and she can't afford that. Her father has told her that he'd somehow work multiple jobs to get the money to help the baby. The detectives look at Blair's father's car and note that the tire has a chalk mark on it, like the rest of the cars at the clinic.Her father (Kevin) is brought in for questioning and he denies killing the doctor. He says that one of the protesters followed him to his car thinking he was a doctor, but he set him straight, saying that he was there to prevent an abortion, not cause one. The man told him that his grandson will be fine. Kevin is then shown videotape taken outside the clinic, in an effort to ID the man.Mission for Life claims that this man is not a part of their organization. He did brag that he got arrested for breaking into a nuclear power plant, and that his name was Wayne. The detectives locate Wayne's ex-wife and their son Will. She claims that she has no idea where Wayne is but agrees to get in touch with him by claiming that their son has been hurt.Bernard and Lupo are undercover at the hospital as they wait for Wayne to show, but instead they encounter attorney Roger Jenkins, who is there as Wayne's official representation. The detectives wonder who tipped Wayne off to the sting, and then Will confesses that he told his dad about the cops at the hospital. Wayne's girlfriend lives out in the middle of nowhere, and she claims to have not seen him for over a year. She enters her home with the detectives, and they stumble upon Wayne in the middle of trying to escape. Bernard chases him down.Jenkins requests for 10 years for manslaughter for Wayne, claiming that he was seduced by the right-to-lifers' message. Cutter says no to the deal. Wayne admits to killing the doctor because all those innocent babies had to be saved. Jenkins argues that Wayne's impetus was in defense of a single baby, Blair's. The disorder the baby would have is survivable. Therefore, Wayne wished to protect that life.Cutter, Rubirosa and McCoy discuss the case in McCoy's office, and they realize they're in for an uphill battle. It's difficult not to get swept up in the legalities of the abortion debate even when they're trying to focus on the murder of the doctor. The defense pivots on the assumption that Wayne knew about Blair's abortion, so the lawyers would need to prove that Wayne was going to kill the doctor even before he'd learned about Blair.Rubirosa talks to a nurse at the clinic, who says that Wayne was bothering them more than the other protesters but that he didn't make any specific threats. It's hard to keep a job at the clinic, and one nurse had already left for a position in a neonatal ICU. Rubirosa then speaks to the nurse who quit. She claims that a woman came into the clinic pregnant with a fetus which would develop encephalitis. Her fetus's brain wasn't developing normally. When they went through with the abortion, there were complications and the baby was born alive. The doctor asked the woman whether she still wanted to go through with the abortion, and after she said yes, the doctor stabbed the baby at the base of the neck with a pair of scissors. The nurse could not work at the clinic again after she witnessed that. Rubirosa gets the name of the patient. Later, Rubirosa goes to visit the woman, but the woman is extremely upset and refuses to speak about the incident.Rubirosa tells McCoy and Cutter about the incident and says that this went against the rules for late-term abortions in New York. They'd have to report it to the DA. McCoy counters that the doctor is already dead, so they should wait until after the trial. Rubirosa thinks that this is information they'd have to tell the defense, but Cutter says that Wayne didn't know about what happened to that baby. And Jenkins would only exploit the information. So it would be best if they never heard about this piece of evidence.Kevin is on the stand at the trial, telling about how he tried to talk to the doctor to plead with him about not giving his daughter the abortion, but he couldn't get past the protesters. Wayne talked to him about Blair's situation and told him that his grandson would be okay. Cutter brings in a doctor who claims that the disorder Blair's child would have would mean a lifetime of suffering, and the responsible thing to do was to perform the abortion and avoid all the pain. That child would be living without dignity. However, Jenkins draws out the doctor's bias against pro-lifers, which causes the prosecution team to worry a little.Jenkins brings in a woman who's child was diagnosed with a genetic disorder but she opted not to have an abortion. She carried the baby to term, even knowing that her child would die, but she wanted the baby to die with dignity. Her child only survived 21 hours after birth. Cutter manages to get her to agree that not all women are as strong as her, and that doctors who do late-term abortions are still giving a service that is medically essential to many women. Cutter claims that Roe v. Wade was passed in an era where science hadn't yet caught up with people who didn't wish to become pregnant. Now that there are many more options with contraception and medical science can treat more genetic defects. He argues that Roe v. Wade should be reexamined. The prosecution finds out that Jenkins knows about the woman with the botched abortion and the nurse who quit the clinic because of it. McCoy wonders if Cutter tipped off Jenkins, though Cutter denies it. Rubirosa admits that she told the defense about the botched abortion, thinking it would be a violation of ethics if the other side wasn't informed. The nurse is on the stand and she explains in detail what happened when the baby was delivered. The jury is horrified. Cutter gets the confirmation that it was Jane Doe's decision to terminate the baby, even when the baby was born viable. The nurse also says that the baby would have only survived a couple of days after birth.Closing arguments consist of Jenkins showing the jury a picture of Blair's newborn baby. Cutter counters that he could have shown the pictures which were in the doctor's wallet, stained with blood, but he won't. The jury needs to ponder the mysteries of when life begins. Everyone should agree that all life is sacred and that they should consider that when pondering what Wayne did. The jury finds the defendant guilty of murder.Later, McCoy tells Cutter that Rubirosa asked to be transferred to the white collar crime division. McCoy doesn't really want her to leave, but Rubirosa claims that this is what she really wants. However, McCoy doesn't want to have to find a second chair for Cutter, so that means that the two of them will have to work out their differences.

A neighbor called the police after she heard gunshots, and she also heard the fire alarm go off, which means that the killer might have exited through the fire escape. The detectives find that Nina has several expensive paintings in her apartment, and Lupo thinks that Nina might have been shot when she opened her door, judging from the wounds on her body.The detectives inform Nina's mother about her death, and they question whether Nina was involved in anything illegal like drug deals. Nina's mother doesn't think so, since she owned her own interior design business. Her mother then shows the detectives photos of her daughter, which both Bernard and Lupo figure out is a waste of time.Later, they speak to Van Buren about having to look at photos for two hours and not getting anywhere with the case. Ballistics have figured out that two different guns were used, so they know that there were two killers. They go over the security camera surveillance video and watch as Nina goes to the front door and struggles with someone. There may be a print from when the stranger hit his hand on the glass door. They ID the print as belonging to Dr. Lucas Nevra, who is a chiropractor and whose office Nina was scheduled to decorate. He says he did talk to Nina but she canceled three appointments they had after he gave her $5000 to keep her on retainer. Nevra adds that the $5000 wasn't that big of a deal, but he seemed really upset on the video.The detectives find that Nina barely had any banking accounts, just a single account for $10,000 which was never touched. Perhaps those expensive paintings were her way of laundering cash.Meanwhile, Van Buren is having dinner with her son - home visiting - and her boyfriend, Frank. Van Buren has no appetite because of the chemo and her son offers her some medicinal marijuana he got from a nurse in the cancer ward. However, medicinal marijuana is still illegal in New York, so Van Buren is upset by the offer. Later Frank says that her son only wanted to help and that he didn't fall in love with a stupid woman. The marijuana would help her a lot if she took it. He leaves her alone with the bag.Lupo and Bernard go to the gallery Nina used to procure the paintings. The woman at the gallery explains that Nina had another apartment in the same building which she could have used for storing paintings. They search the apartment and find paintings, a lot of money, and marijuana. The DEA had been tailing Dr. Nerva for some time. He was a dealer and the DEA was trying to track down the name of his supplier. Lucas made to Nina right before she was shot. Lucas mentions something about getting ten grand to her, and Nina says that there's a kid at the door who needs help. Therefore, the killers might have used the kids as a ruse to get her to the door so that they could shoot her. But as the video shows, the kids weren't just a distraction, they were the killers.A man who runs a fruit stand near Nina's apartment building says that he remembers the kids were playing soccer nearby. They didn't go into a car after they left, but there was a limo double-parked in the loading zone. The limo belongs to Riverdale Limo. The driver was waiting for three hours, and his dashboard camera caught a view of the kids as they climbed into a car, a Maserati. Bernard rattles off a lot of detailed info about the make and model of the car, and when the other detectives look at him in surprise, he explains that in Compton, he picked up a lot of info about expensive cars from the guys who stole them. They try to track down the Maseratis in the area, and then the Chief of Detectives starts to talk to Van Buren alone. He mentions that she smells of marijuana smoke, but when Van Buren tries to explain, the Chief says to save it and gives her some advice on how to mask the fact that she's smoking pot. He also gives her the name of a man who sells medicinal marijuana. The Chief explains that he had testicular cancer and is offering some sound advice.At the car dealers, the detectives find out that the Maserati was sold to a guy named ""Joe"", who paid in cash. They get the salesman to help with a sketch of the man's face, and the salesman also explains that he got a message from the guy a couple of weeks back because he needed a mechanic. The detectives get the address that ""Joe"" gave to the salesman. Lupo and Bernard go to the address, where a car of girls pulls up. The detectives try to find out if they can bring the driver of the car in for anything.The woman, Vasquez, is wondering why she was brought in for a traffic violation. The detectives try to pressure her with questions about her drug possession, but she asks for a lawyer. Later, Bernard, Van Buren and Rubirosa talk about the girls. The hundred dollar bills in Vasquez's purse all tested positive for cocaine residue. If she's a prostitute, then she was hired by the owner of the house, which leads the detectives to suspect that there's drugs in the house.There's a police raid on the house and the kids living inside are taken in. They find a gun on one of the couches, but when they ask the kids about ""Joe"", the kids all deny ever knowing a ""Joe"" and that this was their house. Lupo counters that if this is their house, then these are their guns, and arrests them.The three boys, Raphael, Samuel, and Carlos are in court and being arraigned for second degree murder. At first, a woman lawyer from legal aid says she is representing all three boys. Rubirosa says that she has no objection to all three boys having joint representation, but a new lawyer (Marcus Woll) comes in, saying that he's been hired by the families of the boys. Rubirosa recognizes Woll, and she knows that he's not the type of lawyer to work pro bono; someone must have retained him. When pressed for this info, however, Woll says it's not relevant to the case. These three juveniles had no criminal records. Woll also tells Rubirosa that there is a motion in court to suppress all evidence found in the house.Rubirosa tells Cutter and McCoy that the guns found in the house are linked to the murders of drug deals in Philadelphia and Newark. The DEA says that these dealers were put on a hit list by a Mexican drug cartel, the Vella family. The kids were trained as assassins and retained in the house to go and kill as needed. But there's little proof which says why Nina was killed, since she didn't have that much power. Cutter wonders if they could get one of the kids to crack and tell them who Joe is, which could be the key to their case.The lawyers say that since Vasquez is a known prostitute, then she was in the house to offer its occupants sex, and that since there was cocaine residue found in the money she received as payment, then there was cause to believe that there was drugs in that house. Woll counters that cocaine residue is found on 90% of all currency in circulation. The judge agrees with Woll and refuses to take evidence from anything found in the house. Woll wants to dismiss all charges against the kids, but since Raphael and Samuel are easily seen in the surveillance video, Cutter objects. The judge agrees with Cutter, but dismisses the charges against the other kid, Carlos. Rubirosa suggests that they should start talking to Raphael's parents.The lawyers are in the parents' home, and they inform them that their son was trained as an assassin in Mexico. Mrs. Alvarez doesn't want to say much, but Rubirosa gets her to open up a little by talking about birria, the dish Mrs. Alvarez is cooking. Raphael didn't seem too upset about that girl, laughing about her. And he also sang a song about having no fear. Mrs. Alvarez is still reluctant to talk to them, but Mr. Alvarez was a little more open. Cutter wonders why Raphael was singing about the crime, but then they figure out why the stereo in Nina's apartment was hiked up to full volume.The detectives and the lawyers are listening to a Hispanic song which was on Nina's iPod and as well as in the house the kids were staying in, about the exploits of a Mexican drug cartel. Drug ballads are apparently fairly popular in Mexico and Latin America, where the songs are about various crimes the families have committed. The cartels are somewhat seen like folk heroes. McCoy says that Nina was killed by the Vella family because she was featured in a song about a rival cartel. Rubirosa hopes that an old boyfriend may be able to identify the other cartel.He says that the song is about the Ramon family, who are so cowardly and weak that they use a woman to do all their work for them. But now she's dead, with 4 gunshots to the face. This detail was not released to the public, so whomever wrote that song either did the killing themselves or knew about it. The name of the group is Los Guereros, which is the band for the Vella. The song was uploaded onto the internet the very night Nina was shot. And the band is about to hold a concert in New Jersey. Rubirosa, Lupo, and Bernard go to the club, only to find that the band has been shot dead.They found the lyrics in a knapsack in the tour van, but the handwriting on the paper is different than for the other songs. They hope to be able to get some fingerprints from the paper. The prints are from a man named Eddie Blanco, who is fairly high up in the Vella family. Eddie's picture matches with the sketch of ""Joe"" which the salesman described earlier. They arrest Eddie, who immediately demands that he talk to his lawyer, Marcus Woll. Rubirosa wonders whether Woll would be able to represent both Eddie and the kids, but since Raphael is a minor, it's really up to his parents to choose who gets to represent him. Cutter tells the Alvarezs that Woll doesn't care anything about the kids, and would probably decide on just representing Eddie. Woll argues that Raphael is emancipated from his parents, so he should be able to choose who represents him. However, Cutter argues that then Woll would be representing all three defendants in the case. The judge rules in favor of Cutter and asks that a court-appointed lawyer be brought in for Raphael.Raphael, however, wants no part in the planning of his case. Rubirosa goes to Dr. Burkhart for advice on house to deal with the boy, who has pretty much been brainwashed into loyalty to the Vella drug cartel. Burkhart tells her that sometimes a breakthrough can be triggered by a very small detail of the person's past. Later, Rubirosa is with Raphael and his lawyer, when Rubirosa suggests that they have lunch. The lunch she takes out is birria, made by Raphael's mom. She offers a plate to Raphael and he eats, and soon starts to cry.Later Raphael takes the stand, giving testimony about being taken to Mexico and trained as an assassin for the drug cartel. He says that Eddie was the person who gave them their missions and he told them to go and kill Nina. He confesses that he did the killing, but never felt anything about it afterwards. The grand jury indicts Eddie Blanco, but McCoy mentions that they've found a song on the Internet which threatens Rubirosa. So she and Cutter have to be guarded at all times.Lupo, in court, identifies the two boys who were on the videotape. Cutter brings Raphael as the next witness, but Woll counters that the boy shouldn't be brought in as a witness because he is a minor, and also has been under a coercive environment for the past two weeks and could be influenced by psychological manipulation. Cutter explains that he was in mandatory therapy, but the judge sides with Woll. Woll is given 24 hours and court is adjourned. Cutter says that the defense is stalling for time, and they should make sure Raphael has extra guards on him. Blanco and Raphael exchange glances, with the boy becoming very anxious in the older man's presence.Rubirosa panics after she walks out of her place the next morning to discover that her security detail was not there. She's called to the juvinile detention facility. Samuel's throat was cut open and he bled to death before anyone could find him. Cutter talks to Raphael and tries to assure him that he won't meet Samuel's fate. But Raphael doesn't believe them.Back at court, the judge denies Woll's motion to keep Raphael off the stand as a witness, but Cutter wants to give Raphael time to compose himself after the death of Samuel. Woll says that this shouldn't matter, because the argument doesn't change because of the death. The judge agrees and gives Cutter two hours to bring Raphael to the stand. Cutter and Rubirosa go talk to Raphael in his cell, who seems to have completely shut himself off. They talk to him, but he doesn't answer. He just keeps bouncing a ball on the wall."

Brenda's son & 3 other kids are also in the minivan. The kids are eating ice cream. Brenda asks her young son to get her nasal allergy spray out of her purse. When Brenda goes the wrong way on a highway ramp, she crashes into an oncoming car. Detectives Bernard & Lupo show up. Everyone in the other vehicle died. Also, two of the kids from the minivan died. Brenda, Brenda's son, & a girl are at the hospital. This is a terrible incident. It's really sad because Brenda & the sweet children got into an accident. A bottle of grain alcohol's found in the van.The detectives talk to Brenda's husband Matt, who explains that Brenda was taking their two kids along with their two nieces upstate for the weekend. Matt was supposed to pick the kids up, but he had to stay late at work, so he called his wife to get the kids instead. He claims that she sounded fine on the phone, and he insists that Brenda wasn't drunk. Brenda's blood alcohol level was .09. The girl from the minivan died at the hospital. The detectives talk to the girl's parents Sandy & Bob, who say that there didn't seem to be anything wrong when Brenda came to pick up their kids. Brenda told them that she was going to take the kids for ice cream. When Matt arrives, Bob attacks him because Bob feels that Brenda was drunk. The detectives have to separate the two men.Van Buren goes over the various witness reports, and says that the minivan was going north on the southbound lanes and was doing 55. Lupo doesn't believe that a person with a blood alcohol level of .09 would drive that erratically. Van Buren tells the detectives that they have to wrap the case up quickly, because the news media already knows what her blood alcohol level is. Brenda will be torn apart if she ever gets out of the hospital.The detectives go to Brenda's workplace, Woodmoor Pharmaceuticals, where they interview her boss Zach Marshall. Brenda was a member of their sales team. When asked if she drank, Zach says that he'd seen her take a glass of punch at the Christmas party, but that was it. Later, a coworker mentions that before Brenda left on Friday, she said that she was going to be trapped in a minivan with four kids over the weekend and she'll probably need a stiff drink. At first, the coworker thought she was kidding, but now she's not sure. Bernard and Lupo search Brenda's desk, but they don't find the telltale signs of someone trying to hide an alcohol addiction: no breath mints or liquor bottles. The detectives decide that since she mentioned getting ice cream for the kids, that they should check ice cream places along the route.The worker at the ice cream shop remembers seeing Brenda and the kids, and according to surveillance footage at the shop, she was drinking something out of a cup. She threw the cup away in the trash but the trash has already been taken by sanitation. Matt still insists that Brenda never drinks, but now his in-laws are giving him a very hard time. His mother, who is ill with cancer, is staying with them, and she vouches for Brenda's character. The detectives and Matt receive a phone call at the same time. Brenda has died in the hospital.The records on Brenda's cell phone indicate that she got a call from Matt, and then she got a call from a number registered to Woodmoor. A broken nasal spray dispenser is found and Lupo takes it as evidence. ME Rodgers has taken inventory of Brenda's stomach contents. Grain alcohol was discovered, along with orange juice and some fruit. When the detectives ask about the nasal spray, Rodgers says she didn't find anything but whatever's on the report. Someone spiked the fruit smoothie she was drinking. Rodgers also checked her nasal mucosa, and Brenda did have allergies. The spray contained something called propofol, an anesthetic which also can cause memory loss. It would not show up on any tox screens. Not only did someone spike her drink, they spiked her allergy medication.After tracing the lot number on the spray, they tell the health department to pull all the nasal spray from store shelves. It's discovered that Woodmoor also makes propofol. They inform Matt that someone has tampered with Brenda's nasal spray, and Matt says that Brenda was under a lot of stress at work. She'd been staying late and he and Brenda have not had that much time to themselves. The detectives go back to talk to Brenda's coworker, who says that Brenda was always using the nasal spray, and that she and Zach were having secret conversations with each other. They'd stop when she walked by, so she believes that something was going on between them. They decide to talk to Brenda's son, to see if he knows anything about the call his mother received from Woodmoor. The boy says that Brenda answered the phone, but couldn't hear the person on the other end, so she hung up. The son also says that Brenda's boss is very nice to her, and he bought her the smoothie she had when she went into the ice cream shop.Eight smoothies were delivered to Woodmoor Pharmaceuticals on Friday, paid by Zach. Van Buren suspects that Zach had spiked the smoothie and the spray, and planted the alcohol bottle in Brenda's car, to make it look like she got drunk. All of the 911 calls about the minivan came at around 5:25, except for one. A call to 911 at 5:16 was made by someone all the way in Tuckahoe, 10 miles away. Zach is brought in again and he says that he buys his entire sales team smoothies every Friday. Lupo brings up the fact that Brenda received a call from him, and he says that he must have pressed speed dial by mistake. The detectives keep pushing Zach, but Zach starts getting elusive. They have the 911 call from Tuckahoe, and the voice is clearly Zach. They then say he called 911 because he knew Brenda was driving while under the influence of the propofol and needed to get her off the road. Zach becomes anxious and pleads to go to the bathroom. They escort him into a stall, but while in there they discover that he tried to kill himself by stabbing a pen into his neck.Zach is charged with seven counts of murder in the second degree, but pleads not guilty. Rubirosa wants Zach formally detained, but Zach's attorney says that he wouldn't be a flight risk. However, Zach's suicide attempt could be seen as admission of guilt. The judge agrees to remand Zach. Cutter and Rubirosa discuss the case, saying that a confession from Zach would be better than just the suicide attempt. A foil wrapper from the nasal spray was found in Zach's apartment, and they can trace the spray to a warehouse in White Plains. Rubirosa heads there. She asks whether it's normal for a manager to visit a warehouse very often, and the only reason for this is because of a problem with distribution. Brenda was looking at the sales information for a drunk called Lextenda, which can supposedly prolong the life of cancer patients. Brenda's mother in law, Matt's mother, was being treated at a clinic which used Lextenda.Rubirosa goes to talk with Matt's mother, who realizes that she's not going to survive her battle with colon cancer. She was getting Lextenda for treatment but Brenda had her stop the medication. At the clinic, Brenda spoke with Nelson Quintana, whose father Albert was also being treated for cancer. When she told the man that she worked for the company which made Lextenda, the man became upset.Later, Nelson tells Rubirosa that Lextenda is a very expensive drug, costing upwards of $1000 per day. The price exceeded the amount of money in Albert's health insurance, so Nelson had to start paying for the drug out of his own personal funds. His father did not get better, however, but his mother kept paying for the drug and now has no money in her savings. He did get angry when he learned that Brenda worked for Woodmoor, but when they started talking, she promised him that she would investigate Lextenda. She even got into an altercation with one of the clinic doctors, Dr. Price. Rubirosa speaks to Price, but the doctor explains that when families learn that their sick relatives aren't getting better, they will put the blame on the doctors and the drugs. Brenda was trying to argue that Lextenda wasn't working, but Price thought it was just a sales pitch for her to sell him another type of drug. Rubirosa presses Price on how many terminal cancer patients are on Lextenda, but Price isn't forthcoming with the answer. She mentions that she could get a subpoena on all his medical records, and Price agrees, but that he needs to talk to his lawyer. Rubirosa notices photos in Price's office of him at a bunch of Woodmoor sponsored golfing events.Meanwhile, ME Rodgers has gotten the records from Price's patients through the available morbidity studies from the state. Price prescribed Lextenda to all his terminal patients. Although the drug seems to prolong the life an average of 36 days (according to Woodmoor's own marketing), most seem to live around a week longer than without the drug. The attorneys discuss the case, with McCoy saying that perks for doctors from the drug companies aren't new. However, if Brenda was going to whistleblow, Zach might have found out and wanted to keep her quiet. Since he's the sales manager, sharing the truth that Lextenda doesn't work would have catastrophic effects on his department. Woodmoor makes a lot of money off selling Lextenda.Zach is appointed a new lawyer by Woodmoor, who claims that all the evidence against Zach is circumstantial and then starts the procedure to bail Zach out. Meanwhile, the attorneys say that Lextenda is the reason why Brenda was killed. All the research on the drug and its true effectiveness was on her laptop, which was confiscated by Woodmoor.When a request to obtain the computer doesn't work, McCoy ends up talking to the CEO of Woodmoor, Austin, who made a generous contribution to McCoy's political campaign. Austin claims that Lextenda is effective, but McCoy counters that Brenda believed Woodmoor was trying to sell hope to desperate people at $1000 a day. Austiin counters that without big companies and their profits, then politicians wouldn't be where they should be. McCoy agrees, saying that the complex relationship between the drug companies, the health care industry, and government is why a decent health care bill can't be passed through Congress. McCoy returns the money Austin donated to him, and tells him to grow a conscience. Or at least hand over Brenda's computer.Brenda's computer has been wiped clean of most of the needed information. Only her address book, her clock, and her calendar are left. However, Brenda had an appointment with a person who was not in her address book. J. Wigand. Jeffrey Wigand was the whistleblower who took on the tobacco industry for their misleading advertising. Maybe J. Wigand was a pseudonym for a meeting with the FDA, and Brenda was about to tell them everything about Lextenda. The FDA says that someone from Woodmoor was going to meet with them, but she never arrived for the meeting. Brenda never said which drug she was concerned about. But when the lawyers mention Lextenda, the FDA worker admits that they received a call from a doctor who was concerned about the drug. They can't give out the doctor's name due to the whistleblower laws, however, without a court order. But the worker admits that he's not surprised to see more than one person bringing up Lextenda. Whistleblowers can get a lot of money for their information.The court order for the doctor's name goes through and the FDA turns over someone named Dr. Sharon. Cutter wishes to talk to Sharon, and if they can get some more information about the drug from him, then maybe McCoy could talk to his ""friends"" at Woodmoor about Zach.Cutter and Rubirosa go to a mailbox store, which was the mailing address of Dr. Sharon. The counter person says that he hadn't seen Dr. Sharon in awhile, but that he had something sent to him via registered mail. He had to get Sharon's DEA number because the shipment contained medication. But when Rubirosa shows him a picture of Zach, the counter person identifies the man as Dr. Sharon.Rubirosa tells Zach and his attorney about the propofol sent to his PO box. The attorney says that this evidence is still circumstantial, but Zach decides to confess anyway. Zach wanted Brenda to be given a DWI so that it would taint her reputation as a whistleblower. Zach and Brenda were going to serve the evidence to the FDA together, but Brenda wanted to give all that reward money away. The money was something Zach sorely needed. He only thought she would get in a small car accident. He called her and learned that she had the kids in the car with her, so he called 911 to get her pulled over and off the streets.Cutter and Zach's attorney plea bargain: seven counts of depraved indifference murder, which would get 20 years to life in prison. Cutter still needs the evidence Brenda and Zach were going to hand over to the FDA. Though his attorney says that it's immaterial to the case at hand, Cutter mentions that they have to hand over the evidence or else there is no deal. Zach tells them where to find the flash drive with the data.Matt speaks to Cutter and Rubirosa about Zach's plea deal. Matt thinks that 20 years is fair. He says that his mother died last week, and his son is doing better. Matt wants to give Brenda's share of the whistleblower reward money to her sister and the family whose relatives died in the car Brenda crashed into. The rest of it should go to cancer research, as Brenda specified."

Van Buren listens to a complaint brought up by parents who have discovered their daughter in a topless photo on a blog called Fighter Boy. The detectives investigate, noticing that Fighter Boy blogs a lot about bombs, and has posted a video with a pipe bomb explosion. Lupo notices that the video also contains footage of propane tanks in the trunk of a car, and the car's license plate indicates that its registered in New York. Bernard and Lupo track down Fighter Boy, but he insists that he didn't make the video. He only found it and posted it because he thought it was cool. The detectives still need to find the real person who made that video, because the car bomb would be powerful enough to take out an entire city block.Later, a scared Van Buren gets an MRI, and the scan should indicate a change in the degree of the cancer, and whether it has spread. The bomb video has been traced to a spot on Staten Island, and the detectives head over there. The police find the remnants of a pipe in the area, and mention that a pipe bomb was discovered in the restroom of a gas station a couple of weeks back. The bomb was old and rusty and probably a dud. Van Buren receives a call about getting a line of credit to pay her medical bills, with Lupo accidentally getting the gist of the call. Lupo talks to Bernard and suggests they throw a fundraiser for Van Buren, but Bernard doesn't think she'd go for that idea.The bomb is traced to a couple of kids who also tracked down the place where the pipe bomb video was filmed. The found a piece of pipe and kept it for awhile, but finally ditched it in the gas station bathroom. One of the boys shows the detectives the website with the video, called Moot's Countdown. On the website is a blog entry which says that Moot is going to blow up a school.The detectives decide to take the threat seriously, but they have no idea which school is being targeted. Skoda is trying to profile Moot, but is having a hard time since the blogger doesn't share too much personal information online. Lupo posts on Moot's forum, saying that he wants to do a copycat bomb in LA. Skoda thinks that Moot is a depressive, but seems less psychopathic than the Columbine shooters.Meanwhile, Cutter and Rubirosa try to talk to a fed, as one of Moot's weapons (displayed on his site) has been traced to a gun dealer who stole Moot's carbine from a gun store.. The Fed blocks the attorneys' attempt to get to talk to the thief, saying that the federal crime outweighs a piddly state crime. ATF will not be too cooperative in helping them. And then Van Buren receives a call from her doctor. The first scan resulted in a lot of corrupted data, so she has to do the MRI over again.Moot has figured out that the police are now reading his blog, so he says that he will now have to be more careful in what he reveals on his site. The detectives notice that Moot writes a lot about teachers on his blog. Maybe he's a disgruntled student who wants to get revenge? One teacher in particular got Moot's attention, a science teacher who seemed to be very religious and had been claimed to have branded crosses into his students' arms.Lupo, Bernard and Rubirosa talk to a department of education rep, who claims that he can't discuss the specifics of the teacher's case. Rubirosa mentions that there is a credible bomb threat against a school, but the rep thinks that the teachers' union's lawyers would be an even greater threat. Someone else at the department of education clues the team in to a secret website where teachers can log in and complain about their jobs. She gives the detectives info on how to access the site, and maybe they can track down this particular teacher. Meanwhile, a very antsy Van Buren gets an MRI scan done for the second time.Lupo finds what he needs from the secret website. The teacher is Ron Koslowski. The detectives track Ron down, and he says that the accusation was exaggerated. He was doing a scientific demonstration with a Tesla coil and ended up leaving marks on the students who willingly helped out with the coil. He doesn't recognize Moot, however. Ron was suspended for four months, but he decided not to stay in New York to teach. He took a lower paying job in an out of the way county, but at least he could still teach science to kids.Cutter tries to get the grand jury to accept to subpoena the department of education so that they could get the case files open. They would have to open up the records of all the students at John Locke High school, but the jury refuses to give them the permission to go through the school records of minors.Van Buren finds out that the rest of the team are planning a fundraiser for her, and she tells them that she doesn't want their pity, and that they should cancel the event. But Lupo isn't going to.Using the teachers' website, the detectives match up identities to the teachers who are mentioned on Moot's blog. Most of the teachers can be found at a temporary reassignment center, or ""Rubber Room"". The Rubber Room is a place where teachers who have had complaints of misconduct or incompetence filed against them stay while their cases are investigated. Their union requires that every case gets looked at, so while the teachers are taken out of their classroom, they have to stay in the Rubber Room during regular school hours. It seems that many of the teachers are in the room because of exaggerated claims. A teacher who touched a student's hair was charged with assault. A teacher was reprimanded because he called a student a bastard, but that was after he was physically attacked by the student.The detectives ask for the names of the problem students, but none of them match with Moot's names. Bernard starts to think that maybe Moot was a teacher who had to stay in a Rubber Room and had heard all these other stories of teachers being attacked by students. All of the teachers Moot mentions on his blog are in rubber rooms, except for a woman named Moira Scott. The detectives believe that Moot worked with Moira.Moira and the lawyer supplied to her by her union meet with Cutter, but he's not able to get anything useful from her because of her lawyer. McCoy has watched the exchange and as Moira and her lawyer leave, he approaches her and pleads with her to talk to them. The lawyer strongarms McCoy, but McCoy gives him a piece of his mind. He argues that many innocent lives are threatened and Moira might know valuable information which would stop the massacre from happening. Moira finally speaks to Cutter. She explains that Moot is a teacher named Rick, who was great at his job but he couldn't handle the kids. A student who wanted a bathroom break ten minutes before class ended was told by Rick that he just had to wait. Instead, the student walked up to the front of the classroom and urinated in the trashcan. When Rick tried to stop him, the student accused him of trying to molest him. Rick was sent to a Rubber Room, but the charges were dropped. However, Rick's teaching career was already tainted by this incident, and his girlfriend decided to break up with him after that.The detectives go to Rick's house but discover that he isn't there. Rick's parents explain that he had a substitute teaching job in Queens. In Rick's room, there is evidence of ammo and the ingredients needed to make a pipe bomb. The detectives identify the school and try to get it evacuated. Rick carried a backpack into the school. In the cafeteria, the detectives discover a bomb. Rick shoots at Lupo, saying that he has nothing to lose. But as he's distracted, Bernard sneaks up and disarms Rick.At Van Buren's fundraiser, the detectives and attorneys celebrate the close of the case. Van Buren arrives, announcing that Frank is her fiance. She then receives a message on her phone, and she anxiously makes a call to her doctor. After the call ends, she whispers something in Frank's ear which makes him smile. Apparently, her cancer is in remission."

Chernuchin & René Balcer|3|original|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order/conspiracy-9506/recap|http://www.tv.com|The charismatic leader of group called the African-American Congress (AAC) is gunned down at a political rally. When Cerreta and Logan arrive on the scene, no one is able to give an accurate description of the shooter. All that people agree on is that he was white. One of the patrolmen there says he saw a white male with a .38 running away, but he says he did not see the actual shooting.Logan and Cerreta go to the hospital to talk to the widow, but the Executive Director of the AAC, Mr. Books, tells them she cannot speak to anyone at that time. Mike gets heated, but Cerreta agrees to wait.Logan and Cerreta finally get to interview Tate's men. Books tells them that the eight bodyguards that were supposed to protect Tate that night were his idea because the AAC gets threats all the time.The detectives go to speak with the widow. She says she didn't know the shooter, but she will never forget his face. When they get back to the precinct, Logan and Cerreta begin sifting through press pictures of Tate, hoping to find the shooter in one of the pictures. They find the same white man in three of the pictures, so they take the pictures to show to Tate's bodyguard, Mr. Cook. Cook is bitter about the shooting and acts abusively towards Cerreta and Logan because they are white, but he does say that he has seen the man before. When Mrs. Tate looks at the pictures, she identifies the man as the man she saw with the gun.In one of the pictures, the man is wearing a shirt that says Amherst College Lacrosse on it. They go to the school and start digging through old yearbooks. Cerreta finds him and they identify him as Mitchell Koblin. They trace him to his parents' home, and they give them his address.When they get there, his ex-wife Sandy, who happens to be black, informs them that they are divorced. She says that after she got a job with the AAC, Mitchell constantly accused her of sleeping with the men who worked there, including Tate. She tells them that as far as she knows, he is teaching at a school in the Bronx, but when they get there, they find out he was fired and is now living at the Y.When they arrive there, Mitchell is playing basketball in the gymnasium. He tries to run, but Logan tackles him, and they arrest him. Cerreta finds a gun in his gym bag.While Cerreta is interrogating Mitchell, Logan gets back with the lab results on the gun. The bullet in the leg of a wounded bodyguard is a perfect match, but unfortunately they have nothing to go on from Tate because the bullet was shattered.Although the case against Koblin is strong, Adam insists that Ben and Paul look deeper to find a motive. He said if there are any doubts, a good motive will be needed to convince the jury.Ben goes to talk to Elizabeth Olivet, the department's psychiatrist. She is convinced that Mitchell believed his wife left him for Tate, and that the most important thing to him was to get her back. Stone puts Mrs. Koblin on the stand, and she testifies that she was indeed having an affair with Marcus Tate. She then admits to Mitchell's attorney that Tate was having affairs with other women, and he hints that maybe one of those men was responsible for the shooting. When Mrs. Tate takes the stand, Koblin's attorney asks her about all the men in the AAC who disagreed with Tate's principles, again hinting that one of them had motive. Stone objects and Mrs. Tate steps down.Next on the stand is Mr. Cook. The defense attorney, Mr. Lowenthal, is Jewish, and he purposely aggravates Cook into calling him a Jew and betraying his prejudice against Jews.Finally, Koblin takes the stand. He says he pulled the gun because he heard an explosion, and he shot the bodyguard because the bodyguard was about to shoot him. He tells the court that he only went to the rally to see his wife. Ben questions him briefly.The jury finds Koblin not guilty on all counts except for criminal possession of a weapon. The people in the courtroom go crazy. Adam is not satisfied, so he tells Paul and Ben to go over the transcripts again, this time to look for a civil rights violation. As they review the transcripts, Ben suggests that maybe Koblin really didn't kill Tate. He says that Mrs. Koblin testified that she had to get someone to walk her to and from work because Mitchell wouldn't leave her alone. Ben says that the person she would have asked is Cook, and if that's the case, Cook would have recognized Koblin. Ben figures if Cook lied about knowing who Koblin was, he probably lied about other things as well. Ben and Paul go talk to Mrs. Koblin, who confirms that Cook almost got into a fight with Mitchell one night. They then go to Mrs. Tate to ask about internal conflicts at the AAC. She is uncooperative, but Ben and Paul both believe she knows what really happened. Adam instructs them to arrest her for conspiracy. Paul asks him to let him talk to her.Paul tells Mrs. Tate that he doesn't understand why she's protecting the man who murdered her husband. She replies that she will not let the death of her husband ruin all that she has worked for. Paul says if she is withholding evidence, she is considered a co-conspirator in the eyes of the law, but she does not give in.Ben and Paul do some checking and find out that Cook and Books were involved. They bring them in, even though they know Mrs. Tate is refusing to tell what she knows. Ben interviews Books, while Paul interviews Cook. They both refuse to turn on each other, and there is not enough evidence to go to trial.

She was beaten over the head with a steel pipe. The nature of the crime leads Logan and Cerreta to believe the victim knew the killer. Logan and Cerreta find polaroids of her and her friends near her body, so they ask the girls to come in. The girls tell the detectives that no one would have wanted to hurt Beth. The girls also say that Beth's parents were coming into the city to take her to the airport for a flight to Italy.The detectives go to Beth's dorm room where they talk to her parents. They tell the detectives about Beth's boyfriend Tommy, so Logan and Cerreta head over to his dorm room. Tommy isn't there, but they talk to his roommate Bill Lynch. Lynch accuses them of going after Tommy because he's poor and Mexican, to which Cerreta replies that they didn't know either of those things. Lynch says he doesn't know when Tommy got back the night before, but that it was ""some time after Letterman"". Logan and Cerreta find Tommy working at a homeless shelter. He tells them that Beth's father hit her when he found out that she and Tommy were engaged. He didn't approve of their relationship because of Tommy's ethnicity. When Cerreta asks Tommy where he was the night before, he says he was at the shelter until one o'clock and advises them to check with Father Gregory at the church.Father Gregory says that he fell asleep before Tommy left, so he doesn't really know how late Tommy was there. The detectives are suspicious of Father Gregory's story. They go to forensics to see what information they have there. Forensics finds black polyester fibers snagged on the pipe. They also find Tommy's fingerprint on the outside of the envelope that Beth's pictures were in. Unfortunately, they have no way of knowing if Beth had the envelope before she went to see her friends or after.The Nassau police send over a file regarding Beth and her father. They had a fight in the front yard of her parents' house four months earlier. Beth's father gave her a bloody lip. Cragen tells them that Mr. Milgram is pressuring him to get Beth's dorm room unsealed so he can pack up her stuff and go home. Although Cerreta is skeptical of the theory that Milgram killed his daughter, he and Mike head over to the room to check it out.In Beth's room, Logan recalls that when they gave the parents the news about death, her father was sitting at her desk going through her papers. He finds a life insurance policy in the amount of $250,000 with her father listed as the sole beneficiary.When they question him, Milgram gets mad and asks them to leave. They go speak to his wife, but when they ask to look around, she tells them to talk to her husband. Back at the precinct, Logan and Cerreta are talking to Cragen when Mr. Milgram and his attorney storm in. Milgram tells them that he was 80 miles away from where his daughter was killed the night of her death, and he has a speeding ticket to prove it. Cragen asks them if they have anything else to go on, and they remember another girl who was at the party, Celeste. Celeste tells them that the day of the party, Beth told Tommy he should see other girls. Tommy called Celeste later and told her that he couldn't live without Beth.The detectives go back to talk to Tommy again. Tommy again says he was at the shelter until one in the morning, so the detectives go talk to the people staying there. One of the men tells them that Tommy was there all night. He says he knows because around three or four in the morning, he got up to go to the bathroom, and he saw Tommy going into the confessional with Father Gregory. Father Gregory tells Cerreta and Logan that he can't tell them what Tommy said or what time he was there. When they come out of the building, Cerreta tells Mike he thinks that Father Gregory winked to try to tell them something without actually breaking his vows. They manage to get a warrant to search Tommy's room, where they find a bag with fibers that match the fibers found on the pipe. Logan calls Cragen to let him know they're about to go arrest Tommy, but Tommy is already there, along with Father Gregory. Tommy confesses to the murder, saying he couldn't stand for Beth to leave him. Father Gregory speaks to Ben on Tommy's behalf, asking for a minimal sentence so that Tommy can commit himself to the church when he gets out of prison. Adam tells Ben and Paul that unless they can prove the murder was premeditated, they should offer Tommy a plea. Otherwise, the jury will feel sorry for him, and they will never convict on murder. Mr. Milgram comes to see Ben and asks him to offer Tommy a plea. He says that Tommy once fooled him, and he will fool the jury too. Ben has to interrupt him to stop him from making a threat against Tommy. Ben soon hears from Tommy's attorney, Cyrus Weaver, who is trying to get the bag with the matching fibers and Tommy's confession thrown out. Ben manages to keep the confession, but the judge rules the bag inadmissible as evidence. Without the bag, there is no evidence of premeditation and not enough for a murder two conviction. Weaver tells Ben and Paul that he is going to plead not guilty by reason of mental defect or diminshed capacity and because there is no manslaughter charge, Tommy will walk. They go to trial anyway, and Weaver tries to prove Tommy's insanity defense is valid. Dr. Olivet holds up well on the stand, but Ben and Adam are nervous. Paul comes to the rescue by finding out where Tommy got the pipe. An order for plumbing work was called in at the shelter where Tommy worked four days before Beth's murder. They get a search warrant and pull apart the walls at the shelter, where they find pipe matching the pipe used to kill Beth.At trial, however, Weaver makes it clear that the pipe could have been picked up anywhere and did not necessarily come from the shelter. He then puts his psychiatrist on the stand who says that it is probable that Tommy was not aware of the consequences of killing Beth at the time of the murder.Tommy takes the stand and talks about his mother dying in the heat while rich people were partying in a house not far off. Weaver is clearly trying to evoke sympathy for the life that Tommy came from.Weaver approaches Paul afterwards and tells him that he is willing to talk about a deal because neither side has a decisive edge in the matter. Ben decides to offer a deal because he is unsure of the outcome of the trial, but he wants to make sure Tommy is punished. Tommy, however, refuses to accept the deal, saying he'd rather take his chances with the jury.In closing statements, Ben demonstrates the six blows that Tommy applied to Beth's head in killing her. The jury convicts him of murder.The episode ends with Schiff talking about the guilt that everyone feels about people like Tommy and then getting into a hired car outside the courthouse and saying, ""The state pays for it."""
Don Scardino|4|48|1992-10-14 00:00:00|68007|The Corporate Veil||Joe Morgenstern, Michael S. Chernuchin|3|original|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order/the-corporate-veil-9508/recap|http://www.tv.com|A teenager named Roberto Martinez has a heart attack when his pacemaker fails. His mother shows up at the precinct with her attorney asking for criminal charges to be filed against the manufacturer of his pacemaker. Cragen resists at first, but when Mrs. Martinez's attorney says that the surgery was unnecessary, he agrees to investigate.Logan and Cerreta go speak to Dr. Trevor Hellems, who denies the surgery was unnecessary. He defends his actions, saying that the surgery was necessary and that pacemakers usually do not fail, especially ones from BioNorm Industries, the manufacturer of Roberto's pacemaker.After speaking to several specialists who also defend Dr. Hellems's actions, Cerreta and Logan pay a visit to Mrs. Martinez. When they tell her that they don't believe anything illegal occurred, she informs them that BioNorm Industries offered her $50,000 as a settlement. They told her she would have to sign a statement in which she agreed not to say anything about the matter.The detectives talk to Mr. Cleary from BioNorm industries, who denies there was a problem with the pacemaker. He says he only offered her the money to try to eliminate the cost of a trial. However, something he says makes Cerreta and Logan think that he might have been sued before. Paul Robinette checks it out for them, but they can't find any court records. Paul advises them to check with the FDA to see if there are any complaints. Ms. Kenny at the FDA says there have been 6 reports of failed pacemakers from BioNorm, but the doctors never followed up on the reports. The detectives get the doctors' names and numbers from her.The first doctor they talk to admits that he didn't follow up on his complaint because the victim's wife needed the money. They talk to the other doctors and find similar situations, so Cragen tells them they have 24 hours to find out what Cleary's hiding.Logan and Cerreta go back to Cleary's office and question him again, this time with Cleary's son present. They tell the detectives that they compared the serial numbers listed on the lawsuit documents with their records and found that the pacemaker inside Roberto Martinez was actually sold to Dr. Evelyn Stark to be implanted in her patient, Ethel Barnet. Cleary said he already spoke to Dr. Stark, but she had already spoken to a lawyer and had no comment. When the detectives arrive at her office, Dr. Stark is uncooperative, but she does tell them that Ethel Barnet got a new pacemaker, and the old one was donated to Manhattan Med. Stark says that the pacemaker had a life of 5 years, and Mrs. Barnet used it for three years.At Manhattan Med, a man admits to having sold some pacemakers on the side to a man named Jeff Suiter. The detectives go see Jeff Suiter, who says that he always told his buyers when they were getting secondhand goods because it was illegal not to. Paul confirms that as long as the patient knew the supplies were used, it was legal. The detectives question Mrs. Martinez again and she insists she would never have purchased a used pacemaker. They then return to Dr. Hellems's office, and he admits that he knew it was used, but he didn't tell Mrs. Martinez because he knew she was poor and did not have insurance. He says there is no reason the pacemaker should have failed, because it has a life of five years, and the battery expiration date was three years away. Logan and Cerreta realize that the battery must have been changed because Dr. Stark said the pacemaker only had 2 years left before it expired. Cleary's son confirms that the model that Roberto had implanted expired months before his death, so the detectives arrest Suiter. Ms. Kenny from the FDA shows up and says that the leads - the wires that connect to the heart - on the pacemaker were corroded and that was the cause of the malfunction, not a battery failure. The judge dismisses the charges.Adam, Paul, and Ben discuss the problem and decide to revisit the other six cases that BioNorm settled to see if the wires in those pacemakers were also corroded. Paul visits a young woman who received a $250,000 settlement from BioNorm when her father's pacemaker failed, but she won't talk about it because she does not want to lose the money. After speaking to the other families, Paul meets with Ben and tells him all of the pacemakers were purchased around the same time. He goes back and speaks to Cleary's son, who tells him they bought the leads from a company called Asian Pacific Trading, operated by a man named Ziesel. Paul checked him out but he disappeared a few years before. Paul visits another company that bought leads from Asian Pacific Trading. The man he speaks to tells him that Ziesel was a crook who took him for $50,000. Ziesel sold him leads manufactured in Singapore at a company called CJL Electronics. When the leads arrived, the vast majority of them were corroded. The man tells Paul he got rid of all of them because he couldn't be sure any of them, even the ones that appeared to be okay, were safe. Paul finds five companies that purchased the damaged leads. BioNorm was the only one who used any of them. Adam calls it depraved indifference to human life and tells Ben and Paul to go after BioNorm. Ben tells him it's more complicated than that because they're not sure who authorized the use of the damaged leads. They believe it to be Cleary's son, Steven, who was the one in charge of checking the leads on the assembly line. However, he was not considered a high managerial agent at the time, so the law says they cannot go after the corporation. They decide to indict Steven Cleary on murder two.At the trial, Ms. Kenny and a man from one of the other medical supply companies testify about the bad leads. Mr. and Mrs. Cleary testify that they were not in charge of inspecting the leads. Then Steven takes the stand and expresses remorse for the wire that made it through his inspection and killed Roberto Martinez. Ben tries to introduce the other six failed pacemakers, but Steven Cleary's attorney objects and the judge says it is too prejudicial.While talking over the case with Adam and Ben, Paul remembers that Cleary told him that his father went to City College, but at trial talked about his parents contributing to the MIT Alumni Fund. Realizing that Mrs. Cleary must also have gone to MIT, they bring in Steven Cleary and his attorney for a meeting. They threaten to go after the entire corporation unless Steven testifies against his mother. He refuses, but he says he will testify against his father in exchange for a deal for his mother and himself.Steven Cleary tells Ben and Paul that he and his mother spent days sorting out the faulty wires. When the first person died, they begged Mr. Cleary to recall all of the pacemakers with wires from Asian Pacific Trading, but Mr. Cleary refused. Mrs. Cleary backs up Steven's testimony, and Mr. Cleary ends up taking most of the rap.

When Rey balks, saying he can't say for sure whether Morales reached for a gun or not becasue of where he was, Flynn says to Lennie, ""Tell your friend how things are done.""Lennie and Rey both tell their versions of the story to IAB, who are their typical skeptical selves always looking for something sinister in any situation. It's revealed that Flynn requested Lennie work with him on the sting and Lennie explains that he and Flynn worked together for about 3 years in the 116 in Queens. Although IAB clears Flynn in the shoot Rey thinks something is wrong, and he tells Lennie about his suspicions at a cop bar where Lennie is waiting for him.  Lennie tries to reassure Rey that things are okay, that it's just John's way.Rey isn't satisfied and so begins investigating Morales. He goes looking for the victim's brother Richie Morales, he finds the young man cowering in a closet in a nearly abandoned apartment. When Rey informs Richie that Reuben is dead, Richie explains that his brother was going to give evidence to the DA in exchange for a lesser sentence and ""warm weather relocation,"" but his brother was afraid that if word got to Garcia he'd be killed. Rey tells him his brother must have gone back on his deal because he was killed during a drug deal. Richie explains that his brother was told he had to keep working so Garcia wouldn't become suspicious. But he's sure that Garcia must have been responsible for his brother's death.Rey tells Lennie that he thinks Flynn shot Morales for Garcia. Lennie gets very upset with Rey and doesn't support him, so Rey goes to Van Buren. She's not as resistant as Lennie but she wants to be cautious as they check out Richie's story. As Rey checks more things out he finds more incriminating evidence against Flynn, suggesting that Flyn has been working for Garcia for 5 years, since the time Garcia walked on a major drug bust when the drugs for the case disappeared from the evidence room at the 116.Word of Rey's activity gets to Flynn and he approaches Lennie, reminding him of their days at the 116. He reminds Lennie of how often he used to help Lennie get home after Lennie had drunk too much. Lennie tells Flynn he's off the sauce now, in a manner that suggests he's telling Flynn these are different times. Flynn insists that Lennie needs to talk to Rey and he wants to be there with him.Flynn's attitude at the meeting with Rey convinces Lennie that Rey's on to something, so he decides to do some investigating of his own. He asks Rey not to go to anybody until he does some checking.Lennie arranges to casually meet at the police target range with one of the other detectives who was there the night Morales was shot. Briscoe learns that Morales was not the original target of the drug sting. He cons the name of the CI who set up the drug deal from the other detective. Lennie busts up a dice game so he can talk to the CI Two-Tone. Two Tone lets him know that it was not him who switched things around. Lennie is now convinced that Rey is right about Flynn.Lennie and Rey finally start working together as partners again, when they go to talk to Flynn's partner. The young detective buckles under pressure and admits that Flynn is on the take, and that Flynn gives him money every week. He feels so guilty about it, that he has kept all the cash Flynn has ever given him in a coffee can in his basement.Because the cash doesn't have Flynn's fingerprints on it, they need more evidence. They search Flynn's locker at the police station, it's party time - booze, skin magazines, condoms. Jamie Ross is present during the search and is able to figure out from a lingerie catalog that he's probably been buying stuff on a regualr basis. Through the catalog's label they figure out where his mistress lives, in a condo he pays for, with some pressure from Jamie she gives them the extra bit of evidence they need. He has a floor vault in the condo and his mistress has seen him with Garcia.They arrest Flynn for murdering Morales, his lawyer tries to offer up a deal where he would give up the drug dealer Garcia, but he wants such a soft deal McCoy won't consider it. Jamie wonders if they shouldn't deal to get to Garcia, but before they can really hash it out,  Judge Hellman calls and summons Jack to his office. Hellman tells Jack that the Hellman Commission has made a deal with Flynn for his cooperation with the commission (the commission is trying to find corrupt cops). Jack is outraged by the cushy deal Flynn is getting, especially since the deal doesn't include testifying against Garcia, but things get worse.In Flynn's testimony to the Hellman Commision, he admits to killing Morales and working for Garcia. When asked if the other detectives at the scene of the Morales shooting were involved, other than his partner, he says no, but says he asked Lennie Briscoe to be there because he knew Lennie would cover things up for him. When asked to elaborate about that, he says when Garcia got off the drug rap it was Lennie who stole the drugs! Flynn's testimony is televised, Lennie's watching the testimony with Rey, Van Buren and other members of the 2-7.Lennie is subpoenaed to testify in front of the Hellman Commission. He says he wasn't there the day the drugs were stolen. When confronted with the duty logs that say otherwise he explains that he signed in and then went home and a friend signed him out. When the drugs were stolen he was home sleeping off a hangover. When asked if anyone can  confirm that he says no he was alone. (It's pointed out that he falsified a record and was in dereliction of duty).Jamie uncovers a clue about the stolen drugs, a uniformed officer named Spence probably stole the drugs but they've got to do some more digging.Lennie tells Jack he wants to wear a wire and get Flynn to admit the truth to him, but McCoy wants some time to work on the Spence angle.Jamie uncovers more about Spence,  but it isn't a lot of help. He's dead. She does get confirmation from his lawyer that Spence probably did it, but it's not something they're going to be able to use with the commission.As Lennie's about to enter his apartment building that evening an attractive middle aged blonde approaches him. He calls her Betty and says it's been a long time and asks if she wants to come up. She suggests they go across the street. They sit on a bench across from the apartment. As they talk, we realize she's a cop he used to work with, and had an affair with. She tells him she remembers going into the precinct the day after the drugs were stolen and that it had been after one of the nights they'd spent together. So she was with Lennie the day the drugs were stolen. She wants to testify for him (which would contradict what he said under oath about being alone and not only expose the fact that they had an affair but that they violated department regulations against fraternization). Lennie thanks her but tells her no, and reminds her of why she ended the affair ""because you had a husband and two sons"". He then tells her about Spence. She counters telling him that Dave Spence is dead. She argues with him, trying to convince him that she's not doing it because of what they once were to each other but because she's a cop and she can't stand what Flynn's doing. He still says no, he doesn't want her to do it.Jack and Jaime come to their office to find a phone message from Betty Abrams. She wants to testify on Lennie's behalf.Lennie comes to the Hellman commission to find Betty about to testify. He gets Jack McCoy out into the hall and then threatens to ""Kick your ass from here to Hoboken"" if Jack doesn't get her off the stand. Jack tells Lennie it's out of his hands, that she said she'd call the commission herself if Jack wouldn't.He also tells Lennie that he has to face it, she's all he's got. Lennie still feels ""no good comes of this"" and he's right.Although Betty provides Lennie with an alibi, Hellman questions her in such a way as to make her look like a promiscuous woman who would lie to help her former lover.After that session of the commission hearing, Lennie runs into the Judge in the men's room and comes close to having a physical altercation with the judge. Lennie speaks his mind, he's thoroughly disgusted that the Judge ""gets off on humiliating innocent people."" Hellman asks if he's ""upset because your witness is a slut and a liar?""  Lennie tells Hellman that he and Flynn deserve each other and should rot in hell.When he leaves the courthouse Lennie tersely tells Jack ""Now we do it MY way!""Lennie wears a wire and waits for Flynn in the only place he can get to him (due to state troopers who are guarding him), a local Catholic church. Eventually Lennie goads Flynn into clearing him of the drug stealing.McCoy forces Hellman to listen to the tape and Hellman has to issue a Mea Culpa. McCoy and Ross plan to arrest Flynn for perjury, which will vioate his deal with Hellman putting him in jail for life. They hope to get him to testify against  Garcia. Lennie asks to go along on the arrest because he thinks it will be easier on Flynn if he's there.When they arrive Flynn is alone drinking, he's sent his family away. He makes cutting remarks to Lennie asking if he's still wearing a wire and telling him he thought he'd be loyal. Lennie doesn't want to rehash the conversation they had in the church and brushes him off about the loyalty remark.Asking to go to the bathroom and convincing the guard that he can do that alone, he continues talking to Lennie as Lennie leans on the doorsill outside his bathroom. Just as Flynn asks Lennie if he wants to talk about the ponies (one of Lennie's remaining bad habits is betting on horse races), you hear a pistol shot. Flynn has committed suicide.In the final scene Rey tells Lennie that Garcia is back in the States (he'd been overseas avoiding arrest), Lennie replies saying ""He's probably heard Flynn's dead and knows we can't lay a hand on him now.""Rey asks his partner if he wants to grab something for dinner (obviously thinking his partner could probably use an opportunity to vent to someone who would understand). Lennie begs off saying ""I have to go see a friend, she's got,"" he pauses looking for the correct phrase, ""family problems""."

He gives them a run down of the details as they walk over to the taxi cab that contains the body of a white male in his mid-30s. Bremmer tells them the victim has multiple stab wounds. They found $40 in a cigar box, $12 in his wallet, and a hack license made out to 'Victor Spicer', but no other I.D. When they ask what makes it a case for Special Victims, Bremmer informs them the victim's 'cigar' was cut off and the perpetrator took it.Cassidy comes into work late. Cragen informs them Van Buren wants everything they have on the case. Stabler tells Cragen the autopsy will be in the afternoon. Benson tells him Rodgers is the one performing it. Jeffries observes the lack of doubt in as to the cause of death. Munch tells them of a case he worked in Baltimore where the cause of death was not what they originally thought it was. When Briscoe informs Cragen they just received a call needing someone to cover a case about a dead body being molested, he sends Cassidy telling him to investigate, interrogate, and write up a DD-5. Cragen tells Munch to help Stabler and Benson. Benson tells him to follow up with the cab company. Benson says she will cover the Hack Bureau. Stabler informs them he has to go to court about a case involving a councilman.In court, the defense attorney makes it known that Stabler did not personally see the defendant expose himself. Stabler informs them he was pulled over by two of his neighbors reporting the incident and he arrested him because of their complaint. He explains he requested the Special Victims Unit because it is a major law enforcement problem. He also tells them he is the father of four and does not want them exposed to Mr. Kloster's 'shortcomings'. Kloster gets upset by this statement and in an effort to defend himself he unzips his pants and pulls out his 'shortcomings' for the entire courtroom to see.Stabler returns to the squad room with Benson's coffee and informs her Kloster is at Bellevue because he waved his flag and nobody saluted. Benson informs him the Hack Bureau suspended Spicer's license when he was put in Rikers Island for assault. When they tell Cragen this information, Benson also tells him she had the Watch Captain personally check to make sure he was there. When Stabler tells Cragen the case is there because the perpetrator sliced off the victim's 'unit', Cragen spits out the licorice he just bit off. Benson shows Cragen the hack license and tells him there was no other ID found. He looks at it with a magnifying glass while Stabler makes fun of him. Cragen takes out a knife and slices the laminate and removes the top picture making both Benson and Stabler look like idiots. He returns the license to them and tells them to go to Rikers and talk to the real Victor Spicer.Stabler informs him someone killed him in his cab. Benson asks who would want to cut his penis off. He tells her to take a number. When asked who had his license, he tells them he sold it to someone with a kid on Broadway for $100 that a foreign guy at Cabbie's Place set up. When he asks if Stabler is doing anything Saturday night, Stabler tells him he would hurt him.Benson informs Stabler patrol will check every apartment for ten blocks of Sara Beth's. She also suspects the guy's wife must be going nuts when Missing Persons will not take a report for another two days. Stabler wonders who was supposed to be sliced and diced. Benson thinks it was Spicer. At Cabbie's, they ask the waitress about the two Victors. She tells them she last saw the victim the night before. When they leave, they are stopped by Sikh. He tells them he saw the guy leave and saw two women hail his cab. The last thing he talked to him about was his wife and the fact they just found out his wife was expecting again.While Benson and Stabler discuss the case with Cragen, Munch tells them the cab dispatcher says they received a call inquiring about Spicer's working hours, but could not tell if it was a man or woman. Benson believes it was the real Victor Spicer that was supposed to be the one killed. Cragen asks who wanted him dead. Munch responds 'whoever called the dispatcher'. Benson and Stabler thank him for his insight as they leave to check on the residence of Steven Panacek.When they arrive, no one is home. Benson see the boy from a picture they recovered from the cab walking up the sidewalk with his mother. She asks about him but before they can say anything she figures out what is wrong from the looks on their faces and breaks down crying.While Stabler sits with the boy and listens to him read a book, Benson sits with Mrs. Panacek. She tells them he was C. He was illegal because when he spoke with an immigration lawyer, he was told he would still be deported. The little boy leaves Stabler and goes to hug his crying mother. Stabler gives his condolences before they leave.Stabler tells Cragen the ME found 37 stab wounds during the autopsy. The fingerprints came up clean in the US but Cragen wants them run through Interpol since he was illegal. Forensics found a fingernail with red fingernail polish on it. Cragen wants them to question the wives of Spicer's johns that were arrested. Cassidy and Munch are sent to question Mr. Dupree, but find out his wife is in a wheelchair. Benson and Stabler are sent to question an artist, but find that he and his wife have an open relationship and they were at Elaine's with some friends. He states his wife is bisexual and Benson should give her a call. When Munch finishes ranting about his latest conspiracy theory about JFK's coffin, Cragen tells them they got a fax from the FBI requesting anything they get about Internet crimes get sent to them in Baltimore. Munch goes off about going to Baltimore and the reason he hates Baltimore is he lost one of his wives to an affair she had with a co-worker of his. Stabler walks in and shows Cragen a report from Interpol. After reading it, Cragen tells Stabler his partner may have a problem with this victim, but to remind her they 'don't get to pick the vic'. Munch and Cassidy try to figure out what they missed while Stabler assures him it won't be a problem.Stabler tells Benson the victim was Stefan Tanzic, a Serb indicted for ethnic cleansing after raping 67 women. He tells her fifteen of them are still alive of which five live in the New York area. Rodgers brings Stabler and Benson back to the morgue to explain there were two weapons and two killers. Stabler and Benson return to the victim's wife and talk to her about their new found information after making sure their son was gone. When Benson asks her what it was like sleeping with someone who raped dozens of women, she threw them out. Once back outside Stabler informs her that was a dumb move considering if Mrs. Panacek says anything about what happened, Benson will lose her job. Stabler informs her Cragen is worried about her objectivity and if she gets removed from this case, she will be removed from the unit. She tells him she is a good cop.They go to visit Ileana Jashari. When they see she is blind and her face is horribly scarred, they ask if she knows Stefan Tanzic. She begins to cry and tells them he is the one that caused her looks. Benson tells her he is dead. When Benson finishes vomiting in the trash can, Stabler refers to a line from a Tom Hanks movie: 'There's no cryin' in baseball.' She reminds him Ileana could not have killed Tanzic and asks who is next. When they arrive at the next apartment, they are told Marta Stevens is at work and will return later. Before they leave, a little boy runs into the room. After inquiring, they deduce he is the product of Marta's rape. Stabler leaves Benson for a parent-teacher conference. As Benson walks, she calls for an address and goes to talk to Marta at work. She checks her hands for the missing nail. She informs her she has figured out Tanzic is her son's father. Marta gives her work as her alibi. She tells her Tanzic was murdered. Marta tells her about being raped for 23 days. While Stabler and Kathy are talking with Lizzie's teacher, Benson calls him. She tells him what happened. He tells her they will talk about it in the morning.  At dinner with her mother, Benson tells her about the case. Benson tells her mother she does not have a doubt in her mind that Marta killed Tanzic. When Benson tells her mother she wished she would have killed her rapist, her mother reminds her that if she had not been raped then she would not be here. She also reminds her the little boy needs his mother.Stabler tries to figure out how Benson believes Marta is innocent when she does not have an alibi. Benson slips by asking how they are going to find the 'other' killer. The next victim they check out was in Europe. The fourth victim, Anya Rugova, is blunt about knowing Tanzic and says she was at her restaurant, but her hand is hurt. When they leave, they agree the woman was lying about her alibi and not knowing Marta. Stabler points out that she was left-handed because when she wrote with her right hand it looked like a 5-year-old's writing. He believes they will get a DNA match on the nail. Benson tries to say the nail could have been in the cab for a month. Stabler explains his theory of what happened placing Marta and Rugova as the killers. Benson does not deny it. They take pictures of the women to the Sikh at Cabbie's. He cannot tell if it is the women who hailed Tanzic's cab. He is sure the women saw him though. Stabler wants to arrest them. They arrest Marta at work and call for another car to meet them at Rugova's restaurant saying they have a positive ID. At the restaurant while Benson stays outside with Marta telling her not to talk without a lawyer, Cassidy and Munch pull up ready to transport her to the station. Stabler tells Rugova about the fingernail, tells her she is under arrest, and begins telling her of her rights when she asks to call her lawyer. When she heads for the phone, she grabs a knife and stabs herself. Stabler tries to stop the bleeding while Benson leaps over the rail and calls for an ambulance. She whispers something in Elliot's ear after telling him not to help her.Marta tells ADA Abbie Carmichael, Benson, and Stabler what happened. She explains she was the first to recognize his voice, but Rugova was the first to stab him. They kept stabbing him while their minds relived the rapes.When they come out of the interrogation room, Carmichael tells them she will plead out to Manslaughter 2 and will get 18-months in a psychiatric facility. When Cragen asks if they are okay with that, Benson and Stabler say they are. He orders them to his office when Carmichael leaves. Cragen explains he does not believe it was a manslaughter case saying the evidence was stronger than that. Benson says they did the one thing that will allow her to sleep. Cragen tells her she used her 'get out of jail free card' on this case. When they return to their desks, Benson asks Stabler what Rugova told him. He says, 'I just want to be with my family'.

The grocer tells her the tomatoes are two for a dollar. When she tells him she only needs one, he tells her that is a pity. She responds it is tragic before leaving the store.As she begins to pass the corner, she notices a crime scene and stops. When she sees the woman laying on the car without panties, she asks if anyone has called SVU and tells them to cover her up.When Stabler arrives on scene, a detective tells him he thinks it was a lovers' quarrel since there were no signs of forced entry and two sets of prints. Benson gives him a sarcastic version of events that may lead him to that conclusion, but she believes it to be rape. When he reminds her there were no signs of forced entry, she tells him she did not say it was a stranger. Stabler makes his threatening appearance known when the guy says she was not dressed in refusal outfit. He introduces himself and Benson causing the detective to concede it as their case and leaves. Benson shows Stabler a picture of the victim as they look out the window at her body on the car.In the squad room, Stabler looks at crime scene photographs while commenting on the eight-floor fall. Cassidy comments saying it looks like she was shot from a cannon. When Cragen suggests it may have been a guy on steroids, Munch tells him the Yankees are on a road trip. Stabler responds saying they are in Baltimore. Benson interrupts suggesting it is just testosterone-driven rage. Jeffries wonders if it could have been a boyfriend. Munch suggests it could be a girl. Benson and Stabler inform them her neighbors only knew that she worked at home and carried a laptop. When Jeffries informs them the victim had a regular appointment with Dr. Mark Daniels every Tuesday and Thursday, Cragen tells her to check her address book. Benson tells them she was a writer and shows them some of her articles. After Jeffries locates the information on Dr. Daniels, Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to check the neighborhood again. He reminds Cassidy of his court case the following day and tells him to notify him if he gets hung up.While Benson obtains some papers from the victims apartment, Stabler plays the outgoing message on her answering machine several times while acting like he is looking through her rolodex. On her way outside, Benson is told by  a resident of the building that she heard some noises and then the car alarm. When Benson asks if she saw anything, the woman suggests she is crazy for thinking she would look. When she walks away, the Cargills approach Benson asking inquiring into the amount of time the apartment would be held up as a crime scene stating they are next on the list for an apartment. Stabler overhears them as he is joining Benson. He asks for their name, tells them he is with the real estate board and they are off of the list and starts walking toward the car. As they walk, Benson and Stabler discuss the anonymity of the city. When she clarifies she is never home to get to know her neighbors, Stabler is forced to admit he is never home either.As Stabler tries to fix the garbage disposal in his kitchen, Elizabeth plays the piano. Kathy tells him Sears said the warranty ran out and asks Maureen to get off the phone. He tells her they should not put so much stuff down it. When he flips the switch and hears the disposal running again, Dickie comes running into the room asking Kathy if she has seen his turtle that he left in the sink. Kathy and Stabler look at each other realizing it was just grided in the disposal.In court, Cassidy explains the defendant thought the victim was smiling at him when he got on the train so he sat next to her. When he received no response after trying to strike up a conversation with her, he assumed she was asleep, placed his hand in her blouse, and placed her hand on his genital region. He then made her rub him until he reached his intended goal. When the defense attorney clarifies for the jury that Cassidy works for SVU, he asks Cassidy for the technical term for 'fondling a stranger' to which Cassidy incorrectly responds it is 'fromage'. The attorney corrects him saying it is 'frontage' before clarifying the victim was in fact dead so she could not have known she was being fondled.When Benson and Stabler walk into Cragen's office, they tell him they brought back papers from her apartment, but have not found anything threatening. She did not have any messages on her answering machine. Cragen informs them she left the emergency notification on her lease application blank. Stabler reminds him there are several Jane Does still on the books years later. Cragen tells him someone knows her story. When Benson suggests her shrink knows, Cragen sends them to see him.After Benson and Stabler are mistaken for potential patients, they notify Dr. Daniels that Gretchen Quinn is dead. They explain they understand his dilemma, but they need to notify her next of kin. He tells them her parents are dead, but she has a sister named Ellen Travis in the Denver area. He does not know of any boyfriends.On their way into the morgue, Benson asks if he noticed the shrink did not ask how she died. Stabler guesses he did not want to answer their questions so he figured he should not ask any. Rodgers tells them the victim had lacerations from the glass along with the broken neck, ribs, and lumbar from the fall. She tells them there was no sign of a struggle. When Benson suggests a gun to the head would not leave an abrasion, Rodgers reminds her she is on their side.In Cragen's office, Benson rants about getting everyone's voice mail. Stabler guesses the victim was hiding from somewhere. Benson figures maybe an ex. When Cragen reminds them the shrink said she did not have any boyfriends, they clarify he was uncertain and uncooperative. Cragen tells them to make good on their threat and compel him to talk with a court order. They are interrupted by a call for Stabler. When he gets off the phone, he informs them the lab was able to get a hit off of a print found on a wine glass at the victim's apartment. It belongs to Dr. Mark Daniels. Cragen tells them the pussyfooting is over.Benson and Stable return toe speak with Dr. Daniels with his lawyer brother present. The attorney tells them his brother would like to help them, but he is bound by privilege. They concede he was in her apartment, but clarifies it was for lunch to attend to a crisis. When Benson suggest he was there to attend to his erection, Dr. Daniels finds the statement insulting. Stabler comments he thought it was the absence of one that was insulting. They clarify he left her apartment at 2:30. When Stabler asks where he was at 8 that night, Dr. Daniels tells him he was at the home of a lady therapist from 6:30 to 9.When they ask Dr. Daniels's alibi, she tells them exactly what he already had. After she is told to ask Dr. Daniels why they are asking her questions, they insinuate her relationship with Daniels is  more than a professional. She is adamantly repeats her position before walking off. As they leave the hospital, they agree she could be lying to them. They are interrupted by the ring of Stabler's cell. Stabler introduces Benson to the columnist as he asks about Stabler's old partner. He tells him he retired and moved to Florida. When they show him a picture of Gretchen, he tells them he only knows her from the spread in the competition. They tell him his name and contact information was found in her rolodex and explain she wrote some articles for the paper. He informs them he knows her voice and her byline, but he never saw her. While Benson is on the phone, Stabler orders her hot dog to taste and muses 'Munch is right' people should get off the computers and get out more. As soon as she ends the call she tells him her credit card records show a series of expensive dinners over the past year and the last one was for $372 at Il Posto Vecchio. When she is finished talking he hands her the hot dog.After Stabler flashes his badge at the maitre d', he told them Gretchen was in there with an anchorman but he does not know which one. A waitress interrupts them saying she was with Dallas Warner. She tells them she received a generous tip from her making her think she was his boss.After a little double talk, Warner admits to knowing Gretchen but has not seen her in a month. He explains he is off Saturday through Monday. He informs them he was having dinner with his wife and there is a room full of witnesses who can verify it. He offers them a picture of her if they need it, but asks for their discretion. As Benson and Stabler leave through the studio, Benson wonders if Warner is a sociopath or if he actually believes his own lines. Stabler goes with sociopath. When Benson says Warner actually believes he was doing Gretchen a favor by having her on the side, Stabler tells her his alibi will check out.Benson and Stabler speak with a waiter at The Black Pearl. He tells them Gretchen and Warner shared a drink over a break up on Monday night. Benson and Stabler return to question Warner. He admits he was with her that night. He claims he was shocked when they told him of her death, but Stabler disagrees saying he was cool. He tells them Gretchen called him crying so he asked her out for a drink. She tells him she had been sleeping with her shrink intensely for a couple of weeks. When Stabler asks why Gretchen would confide in him, Warner responds saying he is a good listener. Benson adds when he wants to get into someone's pants causing him to threaten to stop cooperating. When Warner attempts to end the interview, Stabler pulls Benson out of the room offering to bust him in the grill once they are in the hallway. Benson tells Stabler to try talking to him without her. After making sure they are okay, Stabler meets Warner on the balcony. Warner fills him in on what Gretchen had told him about her shrink. At first it was exhilarating since he knew all of her darkest secrets and fell for her anyway. Warner thought she should sue the shrink. When Warner tells him their conversation was off the record, Stabler reminds him they are investigating a homicide. Warner reminds him his word is trusted around the world. Stabler asks if his word is trusted in his home.Stabler informs Cragen Warner's alibi was having dinner with his wife in a public place. Cragen tells him he will use the fingerprint evidence on the shrink to get a court order for his DNA if he has to. Cragen tells them the ME needs someone to release her body to. When they inform him they have not looked through her belongings yet, he tells them now would be a good time to do so stopping them from sitting at their desks.Munch schools Cassidy on the meaning of  'necrophilia' as they make their way to the squad room. With Gretchen's papers and books scattered over both of their desks, they begin looking through the piles. After Stabler attempts to hand off a folder for Benson to read and she stops him, he glimpses over the contents before handing it over anyway. When Cragen approaches, she begins reading about the candiru. When Benson reads what the fish does, Stabler has to readjust in his seat. After Cragen tells them he learned what the fish was in the jungle, Stabler opens a book with 'Patterson High School' stamped in it.Stabler relays the victim's identity as Susan Sidarsky to someone on the phone before telling Benson the blood tests are not back, but the shrink and his lawyer are. Benson asks if she can pull the hair out for the DNA test.Dr. Daniels informs Benson and Stabler that Gretchen displayed c signs of childhood sexual abuse. She finally told him her father began raping her at the age of thirteen. When she graduated from high school, she ran and moved every year. She saw him twice a week as a patient and charged to her insurance instead of the trust fund she refused to touch. She would sleep with any guy as long as she picked him first. She had a history of deranged lovers who could have killed her. When Benson mentions he failed to admit he was her last, Daniels tells them he never meant to betray her. Before leaving, Stabler informs him he will be turned over to the Psychiatry Board.As Stabler gets ready for bed, he asks Kathy how you are suppose to warn children about the people they trust without causing them to be paranoid. She tells him Maureen miraculously made a B in Algebra and Kathleen may not need a full retainer. Stabler continues telling her the victim's father was abusing her as well as her shrink. When Kathy tells him Lizzie made him an ashtray, he reminds her he does not smoke. She tells him Dickie flushed it down the toilet anyway.Munch catches Benson as she arrives to work to let her know the victim's sister is in town. He reminds her chances are good she suffered the same abuse as Gretchen. Cassidy catches her getting coffee and informs her of what he learned about necrophilia. Munch pulls him away to teach him about compulsive onanism. Cragen breaks up the remaining detectives to send Benson and Stabler to an interview room to speak with the victim's sister. After they introduce themselves, Stabler gives Ellen Travis the keys to Gretchen's apartment so she can get anything she may want. After confirming her father is dead, Ellen tells them there will not be a funeral and she is only in town to sign the papers and go to Saks. As she leaves, Stabler tells her they will not keep her any longer. Benson draws Stabler's attention to Ellen's expensive outfit causing Stabler to question the trust fund.Benson and Stabler return to The Ledger to Stabler's reporter friend. When he questions their access to computers, Benson informs him their computers contain sex offenders instead of financial records. He introduces them to Trent Peterson leaving out their job titles and has him pull up the Sidarsky trust.Benson and Stabler inform Cragen that while Ellen used her trust fund, Gretchen's grew to $3.5 million. Cragen reminds them that is a big motive. They explain it is a living trust managed by their father. They quickly add they were misinformed about him being dead. Cragen tells them he wants to know the truth about these people.Benson and Stabler locate Robert Sidarsky at work and notify him of his daughter's death. When they inform him of how she died, he tells them his family is at the shore awaiting his arrival. They explain they are referring to his second child. He tells them Susan was lost to him a long time ago. As they leave the building, Benson tells Stabler if they can jump start Ellen's memory then the time clock on her molestation will start over. When he expresses his concern over recovered memory, she explains she is worried about the little girl at the shore. He reminds her the girl has a mother to look out for her.Cragen offers Benson a drink after everyone else is gone. He tells her his wife, Marge, died while flying on an Orlando turnaround. Benson tells him that while he wanted to drink himself into oblivion that night, Gretchen tried to sleep with as many men as possible to get there. He tells her if she can get into the perp's head she will find him.During the team meeting, Stabler rules out Warner citing he does not have a motive. Benson rules out Daniels citing he does not have a motive. When Cragen reminds them of the evidence against Daniels, they tell him he did not do it. Benson guesses Gretchen cashes one of her trust fund checks helping him locate her. He goes to her place and finds her with the shrink or the anchorman causing him to get possessive and jealous. Cragen suggests the guy's attention would be on the little sister. Munch guesses Gretchen may have been planning a book on her troubled childhood. Stabler tells Benson she needs to get Ellen to talk. Benson catches Ellen as she is leaving. She explains she understands she wants to get home to her children, but they need her help to save her 10-year-old half-sister before something happens to her. She begs for one more day of her time.Cragen and Benson watch as Ellen talks with Sidarsky in an interrogation room. Ellen confronts him about the sexual abuse. When he threatens her with her trust fund, she tells him he can keep it. She informs him Susan called it 'blood money' because of the bleeding he caused the first time he held her down. She explains she can still get him charged for the abuse. She unfolds a piece of paper telling him Susan mailed it to her in Colorado and her husband faxed it to her there. She reads the obituary her sister wrote stating she committed suicide because of these men  Dallas Warner, married with four kids; Dr. Mark Daniels, her therapist who knew her inside and out, biblically and physically; and Robert Sidarsky, her father who took away her childhood, her virginity, her sense of safety and fairness in the world.

Perry|1|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/or-just-look-like-one-12328/recap|http://www.tv.com|"While EMTs and Dr. Lock tend to an elderly patient arriving in an ambulance, when they hear the horn of an SUV honking. Dr. Lock asks an EMT to check it out. As he begin approaching the vehicle, it drives off leaving a girl laying on the pavement.Stabler arrives at Roosevelt Hospital and asks Benson if they have anything on a crime scene. She tells him the girl was dumped in the street outside the hospital. A uniform officer brings them the girl's things and tells them her name is Theresa Burgess. Dr. Lock interrupts them informing them she was hit with a claw hammer leaving over 30 wounds. She also tells them the girl was raped by wooden object, which left behind splinters that were removed. The problem the doctor is more concerned about is the girl overdosed.Cragen tells the team Theresa is a 16-year-old model and asks Benson and Stabler to fill them in on the rest. Stabler tells them she was dumped from a late model dark red or black SUV at the hospital around 3:33 am. Benson tells them she had methamphetamine in her knapsack. Jeffries comes to the conclusion since the face, breast and genitals sustained the most damage and she was dropped off at the ER, that the perp must know her. Benson believes it may be one-way familiarity. Cassidy and Munch tell the group her face is everywhere. Stabler tells them her last appointment was a photo shoot. When Cragen asks about the parents, he is told messages were left for the mother who lives upstate and the father lives in Queens. Cragen and Stabler want to know why the teen was out on the streets at 3:00 am while her father was at home. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to talk with the father, Munch and Cassidy to talk with the other models at the photo shoot, and Jeffries to court involving a comic book called Rape Man.At the hospital, Benson and Stabler inform the father any minor out anywhere at 3AM runs the risk of being attacked. He informs them his daughter's name has been changed to Jazmin for professional reasons. He tells them the last time he saw his daughter was when he dropped her off at the photo shoot at six. He says he was worried, but did not check on her because he did not want to be a troublemaker. He was told their was nothing to worry about by her agent, Nina Laszlo.At the modeling agency, Laszlo tells Benson and Stabler she left the photo shoot when she felt everything was okay. When asked about Jazmin's use of amphetamines, Laszlo denied knowing anything about it. She states that after she left Carlo Parisi, the photographer, was in charge of the girls and their safety. When Benson asks her what kind of car she drives, she tells her a white Acura.Benson and Stabler interrupt Parisi's photo shoot asking about Jazmin's whereabouts the night of her murder. He tells them she arrived at six, but he is not sure because he was setting lights. The shoot started at midnight and ran to around 3 or 4. He remembers finishing with Jazmin early, but he does not know what time she left. Stabler asks about the use of drugs on the set. Parisi tells him he has been sober for 17 months, four days. He then tells them he drives a Porche Boxer. Benson recognizes Parisi's assistant as Deborah Latrell, a victim of Ricky Blaine, ""The Measuring Man."" They tell Stabler he would pose as a modeling scout and tell young girls he needed their measurements. After he gained their trust, he sexually assaulted them. Latrell tells Benson that she received a post card saying he was being released from Creedmore a few weeks prior.At Ricky Blaine's current job, they confiscate a hammer he has on him. He tells them he has not touched a piece of tape. He also tells them he was watching a football game, Jets against the Steelers, on television at the half-way house the night Jazmin was killed. Benson informs him the game was Cowboys against the 49ers. Blaine guesses Benson measurements before he tries to touch her face. Benson and Stabler take him down.Munch tells them Jazmin was booted from the photo shoot for failing a weigh-in. He further tells her Jazmin only weighed 110 pounds at 5'7"" and she was told she had to lose eight pounds. After making a few calls, she went into the photographers office to keep her job. All of the girls deny drugs being on the set. The girls also told them Jazmin was friends with Vanessa Wong.When they arrive at Wong's residence, they find Briscoe and Eddie Green coming out of the apartment. Benson and Stabler tell Briscoe and Green about their victim only to find out their witness is Briscoe and Green's victim. Both girls were killed the same way and at around the same time.While the Stabler family is sitting around the breakfast table, Stabler notices Maureen is not eating much. When he tries to force her to eat more, Kathy asks to speak with him. She tells him the anorexic-in-training act has been going on for a few weeks. He agrees to come home so they can talk to her. Stabler tries to talk to Maureen about nutrition when he gets back to the table, but she refuses.At the station, Briscoe and Green join the squad's meeting. Stabler informs the group Briscoe and Green's victim died in the same manner and about the same time as their victim. The victims were best friends. PCR typing will not be in for a week. The rape kit was positive for oral contact and huge amounts of Benzedrine in her system. Cragen informs them Bennie abusers are paranoid and have a lot of time on their hands because they never sleep. Munch tells them of a case he worked where the place blew up. They had to make a pile for the bomb squad, the ME, and a whatever pile. Getting back to the business at hand, Benson tells them Jazmin stays on set until between 12 and 1 when she leaves with Jazmin and the next thing they know it is 3:33 am and she is dumped at the hospital. Green tells them his victim was found two blocks from the hospital. Benson informs them ""The Measuring Man"" was in fact watching football for the commercials. Stabler informs them she called her mother at 12:20 and from 12:34 and 1:02 she placed four calls to Hampton Trill, an author. Cragen sends Munch and Cassidy to speak with Trill and Stabler and Benson to speak with the mother.When Benson asks about her daughter, Sue Burgess tells her all they can do is pray. Mrs. Burgess tells them Theresa had wanted to come home to her after Parisi's stunt. She tells them Tom gained custody of their daughter and is using her as his meal ticket.In court, Jeffries explains that the father of the perp was raising his son to condone rape. They had found a Japanese comic book called Rape Man, which is about a superhero who seeks revenge on women by raping them.At Hampton Trill's apartment, Trill tells Munch and Cassidy he was having a party and did not answer his phone. He informs them Jazmin showed up to the party late. When they suggest Jazmin may have come to score some crank, Trill informs them the first two floors of his building are doctors' offices. He also tells them that as long as he invites the women, everyone shows up to his parties. Munch gives him his card in case he thinks of anything.Benson and Stabler interrupt another of Parisi's photo shoots to inform him of Wong's death. Latrell tells them the girls left to go score at Trill's party. He says he did not want to hurt the girl's family.Munch gives Benson and Stabler a list of doctors in Trill's building so they can check to see if any of them wrote prescriptions for Bennies. He also informs them the drug is how Trill and Jazmin met.While at Professional Licensing Services, they find that Dr. Deke O'Connor has written prescriptions for speed as if it is candy. Stabler calls to check O'Connor's record finding an assault charge and a DUI. Benson and Stabler go to NYU Downtown Hospital to speak with O'Connor only to find he has been paralyzed since '97 from a motorcycle accident.At the station, Stabler takes an opportunity to discuss anorexia with Dr.Olivet. She tells him it is a way to gain control of their lives. She also tells him if he notices self-induced vomiting, headaches, or the use of laxatives, he needs to get immediate help, but to watch until then. Realizing who he is talking about, she tells him he cannot always be his daughter's best friend.Stabler arrives home to find Kathy at the table waiting for Maureen to eat. He tells her she looks healthy enough and invites Kathy to dinner at Scarentino's making Maureen a little jealous.At the pharmacy company, Benson and Stabler informs them Dr. O'Connor gets fed intravenously. Benson looks over the list of prescriptions Dr. O'Connor was supposed to have written and notices they all get delivered to the same address.Cragen informs Benson and Stabler Narcotics notified him they stumbled on a bunch of pills. He reminds them if they find pills, they have to tell Narcotics. Benson reminds him the thought of getting busted stops witnesses from talking. Stabler informs him they know where the pills are being sent and Munch and Cassidy are checking that out. Cragen agrees to stall Narcotics a few days.The clerk at the mail box company informs them Box 732 is registered to Bertram Small. He also informs them all a person needs to gain access to a box is the key and an up-to-date account. They inform him an officer will be stationed at the box until someone picks up the mail from the box.When the courier picks up the mail, he is brought to the station to be questioned by Benson and Stabler. Stabler shows him a bag full of pills. The courier tells them he picks up the mail, repackages it, and sends it to Laszlo's building. Benson and Stabler return to Cragen's office telling him they need Narcotics for intimidation purposes.At Laszlo's office, a team of officers storms in arresting everyone. Stabler tells Laszlo the press is out the front waiting to get a picture of her. Benson tells her if she is ready to talk about Jazmin, they can take her to their car in the back.Lazlo tells them the drugs keep the models in fighting form. When asked if the girls were killed because of the drugs, Laszlo tells them about Parisi's private Polaroid collection of girls performing oral sex on Parisi. She further tells them Jazmin had stolen all of them.Briscoe and Green bring Benson and Stabler more evidence before Cragen pulls them away for lunch. Cragen tells Benson and Stabler to take Munch and Cassidy with them to Parisi's to arrest him and execute a search warrant for the pictures.While Benson and Stabler ask Parisi questions, Munch and Cassidy begin their search. Benson informs him they know about the pictures. Stabler tells him his version of what he thinks happened. Benson reminds him they have him on statutory rape whether they have the pictures or not. When they place Parisi under arrest, they have Munch and Cassidy take him out so they can finish the search. While searching his papers, they find out Deborah Latrell is not only his assistant, but also co-owner. While searching the file cabinet, Stabler finds a picture album showing evidence of Latrell being engaged to Parisi, but he stood her up. They deduce Jazmin went to Latrell with the pictures.Benson and Stabler suggest to Latrell that she was at the book release party and that is how she knew Theresa and Wong were there. They tell her they believe she went to the party to get Parisi's pictures back. When she denies it, they decide to see if Munch and Cassidy got anything out of Parisi. Upon hearing Parisi was not talking either, they decide to suggest to each of the suspects that the other already told them everything. With Parisi sitting at Munch's desk, Stabler and Benson escort Latrell through the squad room to another interrogation room. She explains to  them how she made his career. She further explains her career was ended by ""The Measuring Man."" She tells them Jazmin showed her the pictures.

She quickly changes the subject to body piercing causing her parents to tell her she cannot have anything pierced. When Kathy finally gets her to allow someone else to talk, Kathleen tells them her friend, Ashley, quit school because she is pregnant. Later that night while Stabler lays awake, his phone rings calling him to a scene.When Benson and Stabler arrive on the scene, D'Angelo informs them tourists found the body. He also tells them he believes she is a prostitute. When Benson notices he seems a little too interested, she tells him to go check on his partner. When Stabler inquires as to what happened, he is told it looks like she went there willingly and then the john strangled her and bashed her head in. He is also told they have one footprint with blood in it. D'Angelo comes back over to them and asks for a copy of the pictures and told them not to work too hard on the case because she was not important. Benson tells him he should retire.When Stabler tells the team how this victim died, Cragen informs him Homicide had a similar case the previous month. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to check with prostitutes to see if they can identify her. When Munch informs Cragen he has court, Jeffries tells him not to mess up the court case by rambling while he is on the stand.As Benson and Stabler approach a group of prostitutes, they break up and start walking away. Stabler shows the picture and asks if they have seen her. When he does not get an answer, he asks if they have had any rough tricks lately. Rose tells them of being beaten badly and then she tells them he was family. Benson tells her to call Victim's Services. When Stabler tells them about the guy holding a plastic bag over her head, one of the prostitutes tells him about a living victim Lorinda and they might find her on 9th Avenue.When they get to the location, they ask the transvestites if they have seen Lorinda. They are told she tried to come there a few times, but they ran her off. As they get back into the car, Stabler tells Benson about the Kathleen's 14-year-old pregnant friend, but before they could talk to her about it she locked herself in her room. When Stabler attempts to call Children' Services to get Rose, Benson talks him into checking with Vice to see if they have anything on Lorinda.Since they are at lunch, Stabler and Benson meet up with D'Angelo at Sam's. Stabler asks him about Carmel, the victim from the month prior. When he lets on that he had, Benson asks him why he failed to mention it at the crime scene. Stabler tells him about Lorinda. When he denies knowing her, Detective Ridley reminds him he busted her a few months ago. D'Angelo reminds them they have a sensitivity training While Benson and Jeffries climb the Rock Wall, Benson explains what happened at the crime scene with D'Angelo. They both agree they would like to bust some balls.In the morgue, Rodgers explains the victim died from asphyxiation and the blows to the head were unnecessary. She also tells them the victim was drug free and her stomach contents were not from a prostitute's diet.In court, Munch explains he was the detective who spoke with Ms. Webber about her attack. He explains she went to Dr. Ott to obtain a prescription for Prozac. When he diagnosed her with hysteria, he told her to undress, put her feet in the stirrups, and picture David Hasselhoff. When his expertise on the subject was questioned, he explained the development of treatments for hysteria beginning with an orgasm and vibrators. To get the case back on track, the ADA then asks if this form of treatment is legal. Munch simply answers that it is not.When Munch returns to the squad room, Stabler asks him how it went. Munch tells him he believes he won the case for the prosecution. Jeffries tells them they may have found a match for their victim. Tracy Henderson who has been missing for two days. When Benson and Stabler arrive at the home of John and Carol Henderson, they hope they have their information wrong. When they ask about Tracy, they find she is a sophomore at Columbia and she volunteers at a literacy center. Stabler shows them the photo and their reaction confirms it is in fact Tracy. Benson informs them she was found in Times Square where she had been attacked. Stabler informs them Tracy was dressed provocatively and the perp seems to be targeting prostitutes. Without saying a word, Carol Henderson calmly walks over to Stabler and slaps him.  After Munch and Cassidy make fun of Stabler for being slapped, Benson informs them they are moving away from the prostitution angle. Stabler explains he cannot see how she could go from a model family to selling herself on the streets. Benson tells them she was not into drugs. Munch questions the outfit she was wearing. Jeffries explains she would wear the same thing if she were to go clubbing. When Stabler says he would not let his daughters go out dressed like that, Benson tells him to just wait. When Jeffries tells Munch to respect the victims, he tells her he respects prostitutes, but not ex-wives. Cragen breaks them up sending Jeffries to make sure the attack on Lorinda was for real. Cragen then sends Benson and Stabler to talk to Tracy's boyfriend.Benson and Stabler interrupt Dennis Caulfield's conversation with a co-worker to inform him of Tracy's murder. They move their conversation into his office for privacy. When they inform him it happened two days ago, he tells them he had plans with her, but she never showed up. He never tried to call her thinking she just got tied up with work. He tells them he watched the Yankees game with Bill Griswald and he won a bet. When they asked for Griswald's number, he pulled a business card out of his pocket. He told them he was the only guy she was seeing.When they arrive at the literacy center, Stabler tells Benson they tried talking to Kathleen, but she freaked out again. He assures her he knows the damage that could be done by not talking to her. After looking around, he realizes the center is six blocks from where Carmel was found.At the center, they were told Tracy was loved by everyone. Only one student has not shown up...Travis Hall. They are told he is a parolee out of Rikers.Mrs. Overton walks Benson and Stabler up the stairs saying Travis probably did whatever it is they think he did. Benson stops her from coming any further. When they gain entrance into the apartment, they are hit with the smell of death. They go in far enough to confirm his death, but quickly exit saying he has an alibi since he has been dead for about a week.In the squad room, the rest of the squad tries to find common links to the victims. Jeffries tells them Carmel, the first dead prostitute, was asphyxiated with a garbage bag, received blunt force trauma to the head, and was left in a sexuality position. Munch says it was the same for Tracy, but they are not sure if she was actually a prostitute. Cassidy reminds them Lorinda's was only attempted. Jeffries further tells them Carmel was black and found in an alley. Munch tells them Tracy was black and found at a construction site. Cassidy lets them know Lorinda is Latina, but they do not know where she is. Surprisingly, Jeffries informs them Carmel's crime scene was contaminated with powder from latex gloves, but it does not make sense because the forensic tech is good. Benson and Stabler interrupt to inform them Travis Hall is dead. Benson tells them she thinks the key is finding Lorinda. Cassidy suggests they try locating Lorinda on Gansvoort.Surprisingly, when Benson and Stabler arrive at Gansvoort, they see Lorinda attempting to do some business. When she sees them she runs and throws her bag into the dumpster before they catch her. They explain they are not there to arrest her, but they are looking for the guy that attacked her. She willingly goes with them back to the station to talk.She tells them the guy stands in front of her, shines a flashlight in her eyes at an angle before hitting her with the flashlight. While he has the bag over her face, she tries to claw at his hands but they are smooth because of the latex gloves he is wearing. She then reaches back, grabs his cajones, jerks, and runs. When she is finished, she asks them if the reason they are working the case so hard now is because someone important was hurt.In the squad room, Benson and Stabler demonstrate Lorinda's story for the rest of the squad. When hearing of the gloves, Cragen suggests Carmel's attacker could have been wearing gloves as well. Upon seeing the position the flashlight was held in, Munch demonstrates how a civilian holds a flashlight and how cops hold theirs. It is then determined the perp is a cop.Benson and Stabler go back and speak with the prostitutes again, but this time they ask them who the cop is with the worst temper. When they return, they inform Cragen that D'Angelo is their prime candidate. Cragen reminds them D'Angelo has arrested them so it could just be a grudge. Benson tells him they have had problems with D'Angelo themselves. Stabler informs him D'Angelo has some slaps on the wrist in his jacket, but he is not dirty. Cragen agrees to talk to Lennie Briscoe to get more information on the guy.After talking a little about their drinking days in the 70s, Cragen asks Briscoe about D'Angelo. He tells him D'Angelo's partner Ridley is a guy with a bad temper. When Cragen returns to the station, he gives Benson Ridley's IAD file. They notice he has two assault complaints by prostitutes and a domestic abuse complaint by his wife. Cragen warns them his psychological report reads like the Chinese flag. He tells them to check this guy out as far back as they can go.At Kew Gardens, they find out Ridley's mother would leave crackers outside the door when she had a john so he would know to stay out. They head back to the station to check Ridley's arrest records against the assaults in his precinct. They discuss their theory on how Ridley went from hating his mother to killing prostitutes when Stabler's alarm goes off alerting him to his appointment with Kathleen. Benson tells him to stress the importance of protecting the goal.While kicking soccer balls at Kathleen in their back yard, Stabler tells her to cut off his angle. When she misses again, she gets upset with him for his advice. Stabler tells her other players know more tricks and to never commit until she knows where they are coming from because they will attack her at every angle. Kathleen understands what he is talking about and tells him she is a virgin just before she kicks the ball right past him.The next morning, Stabler goes to the crib to wake Benson. As they walk back into the squad room, she informs him she worked all night cross-referencing attacks on prostitutes with the precincts where Ridley worked over the past 29 or 30 years. When she shows him the pictures of the dead prostitutes linked together as if they are holding hands, he says they are like a string of paper dolls.Cragen, Benson, and Stabler arrive at Ridley's house with uniform officers while Ridley is waxing his car. Cragen asks him for his weapon, but when he reaches for it, Stabler quickly goes to retrieve it for himself. As he reaches down, Benson believes he is going for his back-up piece and alerts everyone. After they all draw their weapons, Ridley picks up the wax and closes it.At the station, the team watches as Ridley surveys the detectives' work on the case. After almost an hour, Cragen sends Benson and Stabler in to talk to him. Ridley tells them he almost had it out of his system. After telling them about two of his victims, he informs them he did not kill Tracy and he wants his record accurate.When they leave the interrogation room, Cragen reminds them of the difference between signatures and MO's. When they decide he is telling the truth, Cragen tells them he thinks the killer is someone who knew Tracy.John Henderson shows up at the squad room to apologize to Stabler for his wife slapping him and to thank them for catching their daughter's killer. Stabler informs him it was the wrong guy, but promises to catch the guy responsible. When Stabler reminds Benson they solved 18 out of 19 cases, Cragen encourages them to make it 19 closed cases. He asks them if they checked Caulfield's phone records and confirmed that Tracy never called him, Benson tells him they stopped in their tracks when they thought Ridley did it. Cragen tells them to pick it up where they left off. Stabler tells him Caulfield's alibi checked. They realize Caulfield was too quick with the business card and feel it is suspicious he does not know his best friend's number from memory.Benson and Stabler meet with Bill Griswald and inform him he could be charged as an accomplice if he is providing a false alibi. He tells them Caulfield's real girlfriend works for Prada. He also tells them Tracy was supposed to be Caulfield's wild adventure before marriage, but Tracy was a virgin. Caulfield stood Tracy up from what he had been told. Benson tells him to get a new friend.     As Benson and Stabler begin discussing the case again, Stabler realizes they had found a bloody footprint at the crime scene so they return to the forensics lab. The tech tells them it is a 11C Velletti Brothers shoe. Stabler is amazed when Benson corrects him saying it is a Velenti Brothers shoe and they are sold at only one place. The shoe salesman tells them they are $820 shoes and have only sold a dozen. Stabler tells him he wants the receipts. When Benson expresses concern that Caulfield has thrown away the shoes, Stabler assures her he would not throw shoes that expensive away.Munch and Benson go through the shoes taken from Caulfield's possession with a search warrant looking for the shoes. While they do not find the shoes, they do find a voter's registration card giving his parents' house as his legal residence.While Benson and Stabler inform the Caulfields of their son's girlfriend and the fact she was murdered, Dennis arrives asking what they want. They search the bag he is carrying causing his father to leave the room to call his lawyer. When they present him with their theory on what happened, he denies it to his mother. When she questions why Dennis had not mentioned this girlfriend, Benson notices he is wearing the shoes they are looking for.

She informs him the victim is 42-year-old Richard F. Schiller. Once inside he recognizes the look on her face as that of a first timer. When Annabelle Hayes notices them in the room, she hatefully asks his identity. Benson tells her he is her partner and after making sure Hayes is okay makes her way to Stabler to fill him in. Benson explains Annabelle, who found the body, and her daughter, Virginia, rent the room to the victim. Annabelle makes sure she tells him Schiller was never late on his rent After getting hateful with Stabler when he tries to get the uniform officer to take her for coffee, Annabelle willingly takes Benson up on her offer to get coffee. As soon as they are out of the room, the uniform officer tells Stabler the victim wrote travel books for a living.After the team spends a little time debating Schiller's talent, Cragen asks for details. Benson and Stabler fill them in on what they know. Schiller did not have a record. His ex-wife of 10 years runs a local tea importing business. He had lived with the Hayes's for two years without missing a payment. He was killed in the early evening as the result of blunt force trauma being left out in plain view. They continue by telling them there was no sign of forced entry and the murder weapon has yet to be found. The tape over his mouth was the only piece of its type in the entire house and contained no fingerprints. Benson believe is was personal because of the panties in his mouth and his mouth being taped shut. Munch believes it was to embarrass him. Cassidy thinks it may have been to silence him. Cragen wants to know how Annabelle knew Schiller. While Stabler and Benson go to take care of that, Cragen sends Munch and Cassidy to see Schiller's ex-wife.Benson and Stabler meet up with Annabelle at work. As she continues to work answering phones, she answers their questions between calls. She informs them Virginia never came home. Stabler asks for a picture they can circulate to look for her. After giving him the picture, Annabelle tells them of how she came to find the body. She came home from work and upon sorting the mail she found a bill for him. She took his mail to him, but after there was no response to her knocking she went in and found him. She explains she and her husband bought the house for their future, but he left so she takes in tenants to help with the mortgage. She tells them Schiller never brought anyone home and she only had a business relationship with him adding he had a fantastic credit rating before directing them upstairs to his editor, John Freeman.Freeman explains Schiller liked to live dangerously and explore the blank spaces on the map. He tells them Schiller did not like the baggage of relationships, but when he did the relationship always ended on a good note.Schiller's ex-wife informs Munch and Cassidy it has been a few months since the last time she saw Schiller. She explains he promised her no more traveling when they were married, but he was not happy. She muses that now she deals with ten countries a day. Before they leave, she tells them she always knew she was not the great love of his life. As they leave, Munch and Cassidy discuss the irony of a remarkable life ending in degradation.While Cassidy speaks with Germany, Munch with Russia, and Benson with Belize, Stabler gets amused watching their frustration as they all come up empty handed. When Benson suggests it may have been a one night stand ending in a nightmare, Jefferies interrupts saying Virginia was caught shoplifting at a newsstand in Grand Central Station. Benson and Stabler head out to get her.When they arrive, the uniform officer on the scene releases Virginia to Benson and Stabler. The owner of the stand refuses to let them go until he gets paid for the magazine so Stabler pays him. After they introduce themselves, they are briefly interrupted by a man needing directions. Once he leaves, Stabler tells her something happened at home the night before.When they arrive at the Hayes residence, Annabelle comes out and tells her daughter Schiller is dead. Virginia yells at her telling her she could not keep her hands off of him. Benson holds Virginia back while Stabler holds Annabelle back.Benson and Stabler take Virginia back to the station to talk to her. Virginia claims her mother is an alcoholic that drove her father out of her life. The night prior, she went swimming, but go on the wrong train on the way home so she just rode around for a while. She confirms Schiller never brought anyone home. Her mother made advances toward Schiller, but he never took her up on it. She tells them the underwear belongs to her mother. When they return to the squad room, Stabler introduces Virginia to Munch and Cassidy so they can take her home. Munch tells her she can drive when she asks. Benson and Stabler decide to go talk to the one former tenant that remains in Manhattan.They locate the former tenant in a record store. He tells them Annabelle repeatedly made passes at him. When he brought home a friend to pretend she is his girlfriend to stop Annabelle's advances, she threw her out and read him the lease saying no overnight guests without permission. The only reason he stayed was because he was broke and in grad school.Benson and Stabler meet with Annabelle in her kitchen. She tells them the only thing she knows about Schiller's death is what she saw. His mouth was taped shut and he had an erection. Annabelle gets aggravated when Benson tries to clarify that no one else was in the house. After Stabler asks if she touched the body when she found it, Benson explains a pair of lacy underwear was found in the victim's mouth causing Stabler to clarify the underwear was Annabelle's. When confront her about her anger towards Schiller's rejection, she denies it was recent claiming she has a boyfriend, Thomas Dayton, that works in a department store. She informs them she met Tom for drinks at Julian's Bistro and they had a fight the night prior. At Julian's Bistro, Benson and Stabler are told the argument started over the tip, but ended up over who loved who more. She informs them Tom left first leaving Annabelle nursing a couple of Manhattans. The waitress told Annabelle women are better off with mechanical devices.Benson and Stabler meet Tom in the parking lot at his car. He knows they are there about Schiller. He explains he has been seeing Annabelle for six or seven months and even though she is serious he is not sure he is ready to be a father to a teenager. He confirms the fight with Annabelle was about Schiller saying they all started there, but decided he overreacted. He tells them he went home to bed after and the doorman can confirm it.Benson offers Stabler a possible scenario of events, but Stabler wonders if Dayton is strong enough to take Schiller on. When he questions why they were not told about Schiller earlier, Benson guesses she was protecting the man she loves.While the Stabler family gets ready to go out to dinner, Stabler receives a call forcing him back to work. He tells them he will meet them for dessert, but Maureen doubts he will show. Kathy has them all tell their father bye. When Maureen tells Stabler not to kiss her on the lips, Stabler is puzzled causing Kathy to explain their daughter is growing up while he is at work.When Benson and Stabler run Thomas Dayton through their computer, they find he died in a car crash in'87. They check to see if he has any siblings. They find he had an older brother Scott who apparently decided to borrow his brother's social security number after being convicted of two counts of child molestation in '90 in Seattle. Benson and Stabler realize it was not Annabelle he wanted to himself, it was Virginia.As Benson and Stabler see Scott Dayton helping a young girl try on a dress, they ask if he knows where they might find Scott Dayton. He knocks Stabler over with a clothing rack and takes off running through the store knocking things in their way to prevent his capture before finally getting caught. He claims he was just doing his job. Benson tells him that is exactly what they were afraid of. In the interrogation room, Dayton explains his job requires him to help awkward teenagers look their best even on tight budgets. He tells them alterations are often needed because there is no such thing as a perfect size. He informs them he is trained as a dressmaker and it involves touching. When Benson asks if Annabelle knew about his record, he tells her he wanted a clean start that he could not get once he was released. After he tells them he and Annabelle had a normal sex life of three times a week, Stabler guesses he was thinking of Virginia every time. Dayton informs them he is in therapy and has learned to control his impulses. He explains he never had the chance anyway because they were both all over Schiller and Virginia always won. He noticed the looks Schiller gave Virginia. Stabler asks him if the person he changed into was still jealous of the affections of a little girl. He tells Dayton he is surprised he did not ask Annabelle to marry him so Virginia would be daddy's little girl causing Benson to pull him out of the room.Benson tells Stabler that sometimes enough is enough. He does not think so though. When Cassidy offers the guy has a regular job, Munch reminds him it is in the Juniors Department. Benson reminds them they do not have any hard evidence on Dayton. Stabler reminds her of his identity theft and his parole violation and suspects he is blaming Schiller for his own feelings. Cragen tries to understand the situation. They have a convicted pedophile who denies molesting anyone and a dead guy who was not a pedophile who might have. When Benson suggests Dayton may be telling the truth, Cragen asks if she thinks pedophiles always tell the truth. He tells them to ask Virginia.Benson and Stabler meet up with Virginia at the pool. Virginia claims Dayton would wake her up every night he did not get what he wanted from her mother after Annabelle went to sleep or passed out.  She says he forced her to touch him, perform oral sex on him, and intercourse. When she asked him to stop Schiller heard him and came to her room to threaten him. She admits to finding Schiller's body and ran because she freaked out. She spent the night at the train station reading the arrivals and departures board. She tells them she never left because she did not have anyone to go to. She explains she would wear her mother's underwear. After her shower, she hid them in the hamper. She claims she found his body around six, but could not tell them the position of the body. Instead she takes forty showers and swims and she still does not feel clean.In the squad room, Stabler tells the team it was only a matter of time before Dayton struck again. Cragen is sorry it was Virginia. The ADA believes they have enough to hold him on. Cragen informs them uniform officers went over the house twice and never found a weapon. Stabler tells them Dayton had plenty of time to get rid of it. When Benson questions why Virginia did not tell them about the underwear, Stabler reminds her she did not want to get into trouble. When Stabler tries to blow off the fact Virginia did not know what position the body was in, Benson reminds him you do not forget something like that and she started up the tear factory as soon as Benson asked. When the ADA asks what is going on, Benson tells them Virginia was putting on a performance. When Benson tries to suggest Virginia fled the scene and Cragen blows it off as fear, Benson tells him OJ was taking an afternoon drive. When Jefferies informs them the ME found secretions on Schiller and found the match on the underwear, Benson and Stabler finally agree it was Virginia and Schiller, not Dayton. Cragen suggests it was either Annabelle walked in on them and killed him or Dayton walked in on them and killed him. Benson adds another option – Virginia flew into a rage and killed him. Stabler still does not by that one.When Benson and Stabler try to talk with Virginia, Annabelle denies them access. Benson tells her to have her at the station with a lawyer at eight in the morning. When she sees Virginia, Benson asks her if killing a man makes her feel grown up.At the Stabler residence, Stabler and Kathy make out on the sofa. Stabler gets sidetracked talking about Maureen having a boyfriend that she kisses on the lips named Jim Delmonico. He is six feet tall, a junior, and first string fullback. Kathy informs him Jim asked Maureen to the Homecoming dance. Kathy tells him he will probably run into him since they study together a lot. When he does not like the sound of that, Kathy tells him to relax. He asks if Maureen has had sex yet. All she can say is she hopes not. While Stabler wonders how they will know, Kathy wonders if they will know.When Jefferies reminds Munch she is a child, Munch and Stabler tell her the Appeals Court judge is not blind. After Cassidy tells them women mature faster than men, Munch claims it is a conspiracy. Jefferies asks Munch if there is anything he just accepts. He tells her compliments explaining why he is so skeptical. Stabler answers a call telling them Virginia is in the hospital after trying to commit suicide.The doctor informs Benson and Stabler that Virginia was admitted at seven in the morning after cutting one wrist with minimal blood loss. The doctor informs them when a teenager is serious about killing themselves they usually succeed so this one was for attention. They are interrupted when Annabelle arrives yelling at Benson telling her she caused her to lose the most important thing in her life – Dayton. When she becomes threatening to Benson, Stabler blocks her.The ADA and Cragen inform Benson and Stabler that Annabelle is threatening to sue. Stabler tells them she is an alcoholic. The ADA tells them that does not justify their actions. When she asks about the use of kid gloves, Benson tells her if she was a kid she would have used them. After the ADA reminds her she is a kid, Benson tells her she may be age wise, but she is not in any other way and probably not a victim either. Cragen tells the ADA drunks are always victims in their own minds. When they asks if there was a relationship between Schiller and Virginia, Benson and Stabler disagree on the details. When the ADA asks if Virginia killed Schiller, Benson and Stabler disagree again. When she suggests it could be self-defense, Cragen tells her they will call her. Neither can wait for the answers.Benson explains Annabelle had a revolving door of boyfriends causing Virginia to learn men are a commodity. She tells them there is some truth to the idea that every girl wants to marry her father and when he is absent a younger girl could be attracted to an older man. When she tells him it happens more than he thinks, he asks how old she was. She explains she was almost seventeen and he was about the age she is now, but she could not have loved him more. Stabler tells her it is an unequal relationship and being in love does not absolve an affair. She tells him she is not saying being in love is an excuse. She is saying soul mates come in all shapes and sizes. He questions her use of soul mates. After reminding him Virginia did not remember the position of the body, she tells him he is trying to protect his daughter and he cannot.At the Stabler residence, Kathy walks Maureen down the stairs taking pictures. Maureen greets Jim and he gives her a wrist corsage. She puts it on and hands her mother the box. Kathy wants a picture of them at the fireplace. When she is trying to take it, she notices Stabler is still standing there so she asks him to move. When Kathy tells them she wants one more, Maureen tells her they need to go. Kathy tell Stabler to say goodnight to them as she tells them to have fun. Stabler tells Maureen she looks beautiful causing her to approach him and hug him telling him goodnight. When she tells him not to wait up for her, he tells her ""Yeah right.""Benson and Stabler arrive at the Hayes residence at Virginia's request. When they go in, Benson yells for her. Virginia yells telling them she is upstairs. When they get there, Benson confirms Dayton never touched her. When Stabler tells her if Schiller assaulted her it changes everything, she tells him she would not call it assault. Virginia tells them Schiller would tell her and Annabelle stories about his travels. It got intimate on July 17th after eating Ethiopian food. She kissed him and denies he coerced her. She tells them for the first time making love felt natural, good, and safe. Their relationship continued for months making the house bearable. Every time he left, she would cry every night and every time he came back he would promise he would never leave her again. She read his mail telling her he was leaving again for Romania. She packed her bag wanting to go with him. She satisfied him the way he liked. When they were finished, she asked him to take her with him. He told her he needed to travel light and she could not stay at home. She put her knee on his throat and held it there. When he was still, she picked up her underwear and put it in his mouth. She left. She tells them he had this drive to travel. He always promised to take her away from this life to a place where he would love her. Stabler comes to Cragen's office to talk to him. After Cragen asks him if he had a rough day, he tells Stabler they are arraigning Virginia on Manslaughter Two in the morning. Stabler tells him he has a daughter a little younger than Virginia. When she was little, he used to take her to the park and to the grocery store. He would look obsessively at the men around wanting to protect her from anything they might do to her. He continues ignoring Cragen's attempt to say something. When her date came to pick her up, he was thinking about what this guy was going to do to her. Stabler tells him he made a mistake and could not see what Benson did. He explains he saw his daughter as a victim not as someone capable of love. Cragen tells him his daughter caring for someone does not mean she loves him less. He guesses Stabler wants to be the only man in her life. He finally concedes before Cragen tells him his feelings will always be a part of his police work. He tells him the more he denies them the more they will control him. He tells him not to worry when he feels something, worry when he does not."

As Stabler gets ready to leave his home for the crime scene, Maureen arrives home offering no explanation. After he checks her breath for alcohol, he grounds her indefinitely. She stomps up the stair to her room complaining about the unfairness of the punishment.When Benson and Stabler arrive at the scene, a uniform officer tells them the girl was found dead at 1:50AM by a couple of students. He further informs them his Lieutenant said the case belongs to them since she was not wearing underwear. After Benson draws attention to the wound on her head, Stabler points out the cement fragments around the wound. Benson tells the officer to start searching and to call campus security to halt trash pick up so he can search that as well. After they notice the victim is wet, the officer informs them it may be due to the automatic sprinkler system. While Stabler talks to the couple that found her, Benson locates her identification. She calls him over to inform him the victim is Jeanne Gallagher who is a sophomore residing in Bowman Hall, which is not far from where she was found.Benson tells the team she believes there were two attackers, but Jeffries disagrees. Stabler informs them the information they currently have is preliminary. Benson interjects to tell them the only conclusive evidence they have is the fact her alcohol level was .27 and the alcohol was consumed at a party for the St. Raymond's basketball team. Munch and Cassidy get sidetracked discussing how college athletes get paid with items instead of money. Bringing them back to reality, Cragen sends them to speak with the administration of the university while Jeffries bails to go to court.Father McCourt informs Munch and Cassidy the university will be holding a mass in honor of Jeanne's life. When Munch tells them they need to speak with people who actually knew Jeanne, he tells them the university will investigate the incident and send them a full report. Cassidy explains they know Jeanne was drunk. Father McCourt tells them they need to speak with the Hostess Committee explaining they help support the basketball team.The Hostess Committee provides tutoring, logistical support, and laundry services. They are also told the parties are to help the players relax, but prospective players, coaches, hostesses, and important alumni also attend. They learn that Jeanne arrived early to the party to help set up, but her roommate, Shelley Brown, may know what time she left. Riley Couger arrives making himself comfortable on the sofa. Munch informs him he knows about his drinking reputation. Couger tells them he left the party early to go to a party with the Mayor, but before he left he saw Chuck Mosley arguing with a crying Jeanne. He lets them know they can locate Mosley playing basketball off Fifth Avenue.Munch and Cassidy locate Mosley exactly where Couger said he would be. Cassidy informs him they are there to talk about Jeanne's murder. After Mosley accuses them of being racially biased, Munch threatens for him to come willingly now or in cuffs in the back of a wagon later. As they put Mosley in their car, he tells them he and Jeanne went to the party together after basketball practice. He explains the argument was about him wanting her to leave when she had had too much to drink. He further tells them he went home and watched late night television with his mother, who is currently on a bus trip to Louisiana to visit his sick aunt.On their way into the squad room, Munch updates Benson on the two suspects alibis. Stabler suspects the university is trying to stonewall the investigation because they would lose a lot of money if they put one or two of their star players in jail. Munch explains the business/merchandising side of college athletics. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to speak with the administration and Shelley Brown.While Benson and Stabler search Jeanne's room, Brown explains that in order to get tickets, cars, and trips, the hostesses are expected to provide hospitality to the players. She informs them that while she quit as a hostess, Jeanne needed the money and the scholarship from it. Brown also tells them Jeanne began drinking heavily after the game that got the team into the Sweet16 and she moved in with her parents for a few weeks.When Mr. Gallagher claims Jeanne was under a lot of stress, Mrs. Gallagher informs Benson and Stabler that Jeanne had been raped.Benson and Stabler return to the university and explain to Dr. Goodall the best thing she can do for Jeanne is to tell them what she confided in her. Dr. Goodall explains Jeanne only told her that her rapist was on the basketball team. She also told them with Jeanne facing an abortion, nightmares, and heaving drinking she did not have time to push her for the identity of her rapist.When Munch inquires about Mosley's choice of studies, Mosley tells him in an intellectual way that the police are doing a great job.When talking with Professor Rousseau, Benson and Stabler learn while Mosley expects to earn his GPA, Couger expects his handed to him. When Benson and Stabler interrupt Couger's practice shots in the gym, he informs them he was sitting in the campus security office sleeping a drunken stupor when Jeanne was raped. They take this information back to Cragen telling him they believe it is a cover up. Cragen tells them of a car accident he was in while attending St. Raymond's where campus security decided to let the other driver off saying it was a youthful indiscretion. He tells them he would love to take a shot at campus security.Cragen confronts campus security about the entry about Couger being there the night Jeanne was raped. The security officer informs him he was covering for Couger because Couger said he just broke up with her and he thought she might try to lie and say he raped her. Cragen tells him that since he helped Couger, now they are looking into her rape and murder.While the rest of the Stabler family prepares dinner, Maureen comes downstairs surprised to see Stabler there. She tells him she has been in her room for days. He tells her that unless she is ready to talk to go back to her room. Kathy tells him she does not think he is handling it right asking what would have happened if her parents reacted that way with her. He tells her they would not have had Maureen. Benson and Stabler interrupt Rodgers to inform her they have two suspects, but they need the DNA to compare them to. Rodgers informs them the doer has a low sperm count and as soon as they get her the samples she can have the results within an hour.At the station, Cragen informs Father McCourt and Reverend Clayton that even though it is a venial sin in the eyes of the church, they need the samples to solve this crime. When they enter the squad room and give their approval, Cassidy gives Couger and Mosley the containers with complete instructions. Once in the hall, Mosley informs Munch that he and Jeanne had protected sex before the party.   In court, Jeffries informs the judge that the defendant was killed in custody in the same manner in which he killed his victim. When the judge dismisses the case, Jeffries discusses with the ADA what they need to get a conviction with a dead victim and no physical evidence. He tells her they need a reliable witness to get a hearsay exception. When he finds out it is a decorated ex-cop, he tells her to reserve the defendant a place at Rikers.As Benson and Stabler arrive on campus, Stabler informs her he wanted to go to a four year school and live in the dorms, but he had a new wife and baby limiting his options as far as school was concerned. He tells her he wanted to go to Everglades University because Playboy ranked colleges according to their sexual temperature and EU was always at the top of the list.They return to ask Rousseau if Mosley was in class the day after Jeanne was killed. He confirms that he was, but he was distracted. Rousseau thought it was a hangover. After leaving his office, Benson and Stabler express their confusion as to the two versions of Mosley that Rousseau gave them. This confusion causes them to question what Rousseau is up to.Jefferies informs the team both suspects have normal sperm counts. Cragen tells them they can let Couger go, but Mosley is stuck until his alibi checks out. Munch tells them Mosley's mother is on her way.Mrs. Mosley confirms her son was home by 1AM. She also tells Munch and Cassidy she makes him stick to a curfew and his academics always come before basketball. She believes her son will be somebody other than a dumb jock. Outside the interrogation room, Munch informs Cragen that no matter what they do to Mosley, his mother can punish him worse. Cragen then orders Mosley's release.Benson and Stabler return to discuss Rousseau with Brown. She informs them his class was originally supposed to be a seminar. She tells them Rousseau began looking at Jeanne, but Jeanne was not into it. She explains Rousseau was everywhere Jeanne went...the bookstore, the library. She tells them the only way a tenured professor will lose their job is to kill someone.Benson and Stabler discuss the problems Jeanne had with Rousseau with Father McCourt. He says it was his word against hers and he told Rousseau to adjust his behavior accordingly. Benson tell him he should have been in jail. Stabler explains it is called stalking or it could lead up to Menacing in the first degree. Benson reminds him the District Attorney makes the decisions on the charges filed, not him.After Cragen reads through Rousseau's record, ADA Carmichael tells him it sounds like a time line of sex crime legislation. Carmichael tells him she needs physical evidence before they can arrest him. When Cragen tells her they will re-canvas, she tells him to search his office and home as well.When Stabler drops Maureen off at school, he jumps out of the car ready to settle things with her. She tells him she did not do anything. He says he believes her, but he reminds her he sees the bad part of the city every day and he does not want one of the calls he gets to be to pick up her body parts. They both apologize as the bell rings.While looking at the makeshift memorial the students set up for Jeanne, Stabler tells Benson if she lets the place he dies turn into that, he will haunt her for the rest of her life. They begin looking over the crime scene again. Stabler decides since they did not find the murder weapon on the ground, maybe it was a building. As they look at the building walls, they notice the stairs. Benson alleges she was pushed down the stairs and hit her head.While speaking with Rousseau's assistant, they find she does all of the grading, but he keeps his own schedule. When Stabler spots the schedule on the desk and looks over it, they realize it was Jeanne's schedule. His assistant tells them he is in class in the Quad. When they arrive in the Quad, Stabler dismisses his class while Benson places him under arrest.In the interrogation room surrounded by attorneys and cops, Rousseau tells them he did not rape or kill Jeanne. Stabler and Benson present their take on what happened, but Rousseau tells them she was already dead when he carried her into the bushes to make love to her. When everyone else leaves the room, Father McCourt tells him he is responsible for his own legal fees. Rousseau tells him he makes his confession to God. Rousseau's attorney gets Carmichael to plea the charges down to sex with a deceased person. Carmichael walks back into the room and tells Rousseau they also have him on obstruction and disturbing a crime scene.  She also tells him she will make sure he serves them consecutively.Munch and Cassidy arrive at the Mosleys' to find them packing for their move. Mosley complains about the problems the case has caused him. Munch tells him he is a fan of his. He also tells him he handled himself like a man through the entire thing. He apologizes on behalf of the police force. Mosley complains about losing a year of eligibility. Before they leave, Munch tells him Couger will be indicted for rape.

They are told he was last seen Friday night between 6 and 8. They will not have a positive ID until they notify his family. The boys tell Benson they were playing touch football when the ball went into the bushes where the body was found. While Benson tries to get the whole story, Stabler gets information from the scene. Stabler is informed the 8-year-old was assaulted, strangled, and left in a shallow grave. When Benson and Stabler go to inform his parents, his mother starts yelling for her husband.When Cragen asks what they have learned, they begin telling him general lessons learned until he stops them clarifying the case. Benson begins giving them a run down on the victim when Stabler adds Ryan was found naked from the waist down with signs of sexual assault. Benson tells them he had ligature marks around his neck and bruises covering his body. Stabler tells them there was no sign of a struggle and no evidence found. Cassidy clarifies the boy was found in a shallow grave. Benson tells them they suspect the crime took place somewhere in the marshes behind the field. Cragen tells them the will keep uniforms searching the marshes. Stabler tells them the parents reported the boy missing 40 hours before he was found. Benson informs them Ryan died Friday night around 5. The bruises were caused by a hand. Jefferies tells them she will check out the adults in the boy's life and check for registered sex offenders in the area. Munch and Cassidy deduce from the MO that the perp is a stranger. Benson and Stabler inform them the boy was heading for a comic book store in search of Pokemon cards when he was attacked. Cragen sends them out to canvas the neighborhood.When Munch and Cassidy ask a few girl scouts if they know who might hurt Ryan, they are told Mike D and Jimmy G. When they locate the teens, they are told Turbit had been riding his bike around school every day for about a month. The teens tell them he lives in an apartment on Linwood.When Benson and Stabler question Bill Turbit, he claims he likes the park for the history it holds. He tells them he takes that route to clear his mind after working at the recycling center. He rides his bike for the environment. He informs them the chain has been stolen and it has been moved on him. Stabler informs him of the investigation. Turbit tells them instead of coming straight home on Friday night, he went to the tavern. When Stabler attempts to set his glass down on his stamp collection case, Turbit freaks out. As they leave, Stabler informs Benson that his father used to collect stamps. He explains the appeal as it being a lesson in the history of transportation and communication. He tells her his father sold his collection when Maureen was born to buy a bassinet and help with the rent. When they locate Turbit's bike, they collect a sample of the dirt on the tire.Munch explains to Cragen that since his parents told him to never eat sweets when he was growing up that he overdoes it as an adult. From this statement, Cassidy deduces his parents must have felt the same way about marriage. Cragen informs Benson and Stabler that forensics is working on matching the dirt and Jeffries is working on Turbit's background. Stabler tells them of the incident with the stamp collection. When Benson tells Cragen they need to search Turbit's home, he tells her they need a positive ID first so he arranges a line-up containing Turbit for the teens to view. They both ID Turbit.While they talk to Turbit, Benson and Stabler learn he plays Penny Ante Poker at the tavern with some unknown guys. He decided to go there on that night because he had acquired a special stamp and he wanted to celebrate. When they start asking about Ryan, Jeffries interrupts them. She informs them there are 9 sex offenders in the area, but only one MO matches the case. She informs them he was convicted of molesting a boy two months older than Ryan.When Benson and Stabler arrive to search Turbit's home, they are mobbed by parents from the neighborhood who are upset that he is living there and they did not know about his history. When they return to the station, the team questions the precinct's failure to notify the community of Turbit's history and the prison psychiatrist's agreement for Turbit to be released. Cragen reminds them people act differently when they have to run their own life. Stabler reminds them this victim is dead. The psychiatrist explains the details of Turbit's conviction claiming he was psychotic at the time. Stabler listens to Turbit's lawyer complain about the rights of public safety violating her client's rights while they walk to observe the collection of a DNA sample from Turbit. When they arrive, Turbit is telling them not to. When he fights, Stabler subdues him for the collection.Ryan's mother asks Benson and Stabler if they have found his glasses yet. When she tells them they are still looking, his father tells them to keep in touch.When Stabler joins his family at the park for a picnic, Dickie is not with them. He looks around and still cannot find him. He takes off running over the hill to locate his son. When he finds him, he scoops him into his arms and hugs him for dear life.When Stabler questions the guy at the tavern, it is confirmed that Turbit was there Friday night, but he left for a few hours and then returned. He also denied Turbit was playing cards that night.While Munch and Cassidy collect Turbit's bike and chain, Cassidy tells him that after seeing cases involving children his thoughts of having kids of their own disappear.At the lab, Benson and Stabler are told the dirt from the bike and the dirt from the crime scene match, but the same dirt is all over the area. The tech also shows them the life-pictures of the ligature marks on his neck. When they see the pattern, Benson holds up the chain for comparison. The design matches, but now they need to test the chain for DNA. Benson and Stabler meet with the ADA in Cragen's office. They inform her of the new found evidence, the lack of an alibi, and his prior bad act. She tells them to talk to his first victim and compare the MO's. If they match, she lock him up.When Benson and Stabler arrive at the home of Christopher James, his mother calls for him. When Stabler takes a step towards him and he flinches, Stabler joins the mother in the other room. Once they are gone, Benson tells Christopher about Ryan and tells him she needs to record his story. After he tells her his story, she turns off the recorder and thanks him. When she tells him her first name as he requests, he tells her the meaning and its origin.When Stabler and Benson arrest Turbit at his home, the guy from the bar comes forward to tell them he lied when he said Turbit was not at his bar all night. He warns them that even if he did not hurt Ryan, he will hurt someone else.When Cragen tells them they cannot hold him any more, Stabler informs him the judge denied his bail. When asked about the bartender, Stabler tells him the guy is a retired transit cop and felt guilty for having lied to a fellow cop. While Cragen is on the phone, Benson and Stabler remind the ADA they have two eyewitnesses that place Turbit at the scene and the chain matches the pattern on his neck. The ADA reminds them the eyewitnesses are teenagers and the DNA is not back on the chain. Cragen tells them not to do anything because he was just called into a meeting with the District Attorney.State Attorney General Morris Klein tells Cragen they need him to hold Turbit. Cragen tells him that he cannot without more evidence. Klein tells him about an effort to have child molesters civilly committed once they are released from prison. Cragen figures this is meant to be a test case and reminds Klein the rule is supposed to be ""You do the crime, you do the time."" After a little pleading, Cragen gives Klein 24 hours to complete whatever he needs to. When Stabler picks Dickie up at school, Dickie informs him he has learned that his father puts child molesters in jail from a ate. Dickie tells him he can explain he is a cop to his when he comes to talk to them.While Dr. Greenblatt evaluates Turbit, Cragen tells Benson and Stabler his point of view on the psychiatric review. He believes the state searched the pool of psychiatrist until they found one that agreed with their agenda. He also believes it is situational ethics. Turbit tells Dr. Greenblatt that when he saw the crime scene photos of Christopher he could not believe he did it. He also tells her he does not remember doing it. He then informs her he is not sure what scares him more - what was done to the boy or that he did it. Cragen calls for the DNA results and finds it was not a match so he orders Turbit released, but tells Stabler he will have uniforms watching him. Dr. Greenblatt asks Cragen for Benson and Stabler's presence at the hearing for an hour or two. Cragen suggest using chemical castration or Depoprovera, but she informs him if one shot is missed then the drug loses its effectiveness. Benson suggests therapy, but Greenblatt says she cannot set his rehabilitation to a certain number of sessions. She believes civil commitment is a preemptive strike to save the community.As Turbit exits the squad room, every cop watches him all the way. When Benson and Stabler update the parents, they tell them they do not believe Turbit hurt their son, but a hearing is being held to see about getting him off the street.Stabler tells Dickie's to actually read the ID's of cops. He tells them child molesters like to play act. Child molesters also know kids like to please grown ups so they may ask for help. He tells them to never get in a car with someone you do not know. He tells them if someone is hurting them yell ""No!"" then go tell a grown up they trust. If they have no grown ups to tell, then tell a friend. If their parents are the ones hurting them, Stabler says to tell Dickie and Dickie will tell him.At the civil commitment hearing, Turbit's lawyer uses her time to question to make the point that the legislation is just a way to get around double jeopardy. When the judge breaks for the day, Stabler tells Benson he agrees with Greenblatt and he believes the only reason she does not is the fact she does not have kids. While Turbit and his lawyer walk down the steps of the courthouse, Ryan's father shoots and kills Turbit.When Cragen calls the shooting a version of an eye for an eye, Munch adds the wrong eye was shot. The team decides they are back at square one and need to speak with the eyewitnesses. Cassidy tries to get Jimmy G to relax by offering him a cola and taking a deep breath. Cassidy asks which side Turbit rode his bike. He tells him the wood side. Munch asks Mike D the same question, but he says by the river. They decide to print both of them and take blood. Cassidy says they need to search by the river.Cassidy describes the clinical phase to Stabler. When Cassidy asks what the next phase is, Stabler tells him he does not want to know. After a false alarm with the metal detector, Cassidy finds Ryan's glasses. At the lab, Benson shows Stabler the partial fingerprint lifted from Ryan's glasses. He gives the tech Jimmy G's fingerprint. After comparing them, the tech decides it is a match. When the chain is found in the marsh, Munch and Cassidy have it sent to the lab for analysis. The tech tells Benson and Stabler the DNA on the chain matches Ryan's. He also informs them DNA retrieved from under Ryan's nails matches one of the suspects. When Benson and Stabler ask Jimmy G what happened, he says he does not know. Benson tells him Mike D will tell them. When they question Mike D, they tell him they do not believe it was his idea. They believe he went along with Jimmy G. The boys tell them everything was fine until Ryan lost his glasses and started freaking out. He was killed while they were trying to keep him from screaming."
Peter Medak|8|8|1999-11-22 00:00:00|E0911|Stalked||Roger Garrett|1|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/stalked-12333/recap|http://www.tv.com|When ADA Karen Fitzgerald is raped and murdered, the SVU squad is pressured to find the killer quickly. As the detectives discuss the case in the squad room, Benson reveals that she had been an acquaintance of hers. Jeffries adds that the ADA was raped, hit in the head with a rock, and shot twice. Munch says the case is reminiscent of the Labor Day rapist, and Cragen asks Munch, Jeffries, and Cassidy to pull the Labor Day files and search for any parallels to see if they might be looking at the same M.O. and/or the same perp.Benson and Stabler head to the crime scene in Central Park. Crime Scene Investigators tell the two detectives that the ADA was grabbed and pulled into the bushes. A book that she was reading is found on the opposite side of the knoll from which the body has been found, and the detectives surmise that she must have been sitting on the park bench below. A bird watcher on the bench admitted he was practically pushed off the bench by the perp and is brought in to try to make an ID on the perp. Out of the photos, he makes no less than ten IDs claiming all of them look like the man. Afterwards, Cragen tells Benson and Stabler that cross-references of the bird watcher's IDs match two defendants in Fitzgerald's old cases – one is Kenneth Maggio who did time for sodomy but is now out on parole. The second is Richard White who pleaded out on a date rape charge and did no time. Benson and Stabler head out to interview White.At White's office, the man said he was innocent and pleaded out on his counsel's recommendation. He added that he harbored no ill feelings toward Fitzgerald, whom he said was only doing her job. The detectives ask about his whereabouts yesterday between 3 and 5pm. White said he was previewing a house, and this could be documented because he had to put a code into a lock box at the house before he could enter. He said his alibi can also be corroborated by his partner, Kimberly Phillips, who knew his whereabouts. Benson and Stabler make a trip to Krim Properties to check White's alibi of registering his code in the properties' lock box. They corroborate his story. White 's code was entered at four o'clock. Meanwhile, Jeffries and Munch go back to a witness, Mr. Levin, who saw a man running from the scene in the Labor Day rape. The man IDs a Canadian man who was deported back to Canada. Cassidy goes to call and see if the man is registered. Munch and Cassidy follow up and find that DNA evidence in an old case is a match to the Labor Day rape case, but the man has fled somewhere in Canada and the authorities there are looking for him. The pair then head off to a doughnut shop where Maggio is working to follow up on the Maggio/Fitzgerald link. Maggio tells the two they can't pin this latest rape on him. Maggio drops his pants to reveal that in prison he was given a 'welcome' with a combination or soap and sulfuric acid leaving him permanently impotent. At the station debriefing, Munch says the Canadian man matching the Labor Day rapist's DNA is currently being searched for by Canadian officials. Benson and Stabler add that White's alibi holds up, but a review of the court documents revealed that Fitzgerald really dragged him through the mud before letting him plead down. Cragen asks Munch to follow up with White's date rape victim, Louise Billings. Jeffries has scheduled an afternoon meeting with Fitzgerald's best friend, Joan Simon. The detectives head out for their respective assignments.At Billings' apartment, Munch and Cassidy interview Louise. She revealed he was a sweet man that had a dark streak. After they broke it off, she kept running in to him repeatedly which Munch thought was a bit odd. Billings added that he was so sweet upon these meetings that she finally invited him up to dinner. At that dinner, he got drunk, violent, and raped her. On top of that, she said, he had the nerve to send her flowers the very next day. Karen Fitzgerald gave her the courage to press charges against him.As Benson and Stabler meet with Joan Simon, Fitzgerald's friend from her law school days, she said the ADA had been fearless, but about a month ago they had been out to dinner and a man was smiling at Karen. Uncharacteristically, Karen got rattled when Joan pointed him out, but wouldn't say why. Benson produces a photo lineup page and Joan IDs White in the photo lineup. In Cragen's office, Benson says that White must have been stalking his victims. As they walk out, Munch tells Cragen and the other detectives that he has been reviewing the court transcripts. White's partner, Kimberly Phillips, is his alibi in the Fitzgerald case, and she also served as a character witness in his rape trial. Benson and Stabler head out to meet with Phillips. She shows them how the lock box/code system works. Upon questioning, she adds that she met White at an open house and he suggested they go into business together, even offering to put up the seed money. Finding him a bit odd, she initially said no, and he sent her flowers the following day with a note that said 'No hard feelings'. Still, she kept running into him at various open houses and he persisted with the idea. Finally, she agreed and they've been partnered for two years. After she leaves, both of the detectives express the feeling that she's holding out on them. Benson believes that White must have something on Phillips and adds that she believes that he craves control and takes revenge on those who try to take that control away from him. In his attempts to regain control, Benson believes White raped Billings and then he killed Fitzgerald. As they discuss this with Cragen, he tells the two to bring White in for questioning.In the interrogation room, White attempts to flirt with Benson. She asks him if this is some of his famous charm and tells him that his alibi is shredding. She says that anyone can get into the lock box with another ID as long as they know that person's code. She leads him to believe that his partner has said he wasn't there that day. He counters with personal information about Benson including her college and work in the SVU squad. He says if they don't have any further evidence, he's got a house to show. White is allowed to leave. Back in the squad room, Munch tells the group that the Canadian guy is clear. He turned up dead in a smack house in Canada. Secondly, he says that he talked to a friend of his on the realty board and found out that White not only sells houses, but also makes loans – mostly to low income buyers who don't read the fine print, and 70% of those loans wind up in foreclosure. High interest and high penalties help to make White's loan business more profitable than his real estate business. White's partner, Phillips, is not a partner in the loan division and so pulls down almost nothing. Benson and Stabler go to the bank to request the bank records for Richard White and Kimberly Phillips. After a little friendly persuasion, they have the records. Those records reveal that Phillips deposits a paycheck from White/Phillips Realty each week as well as $3000 cash each week. White Loan Company withdraws $3000 each week and puts it under miscellaneous expenses. Phillips is getting three grand a week under the table. As the two detectives are talking, Stabler gets a call on his cell phone. There is no beeper assigned to Kimberly Phillips. She has to be carrying around White's. The two go to meet with Phillips again.Benson and Stabler tell her that they don't care about the IRS as long as she tells them the truth. Phillips reveals that the initial approach by White of giving loans to low income clients just didn't sit well with her and that was why she refused him. Right after, he got a frightening look in his eyes whereas Phillips thought he might hit her right in front of the other brokers, but he managed to pull himself together. However, when she received the flowers from White the next day, she was truly frightened because he had no way of knowing her home address. The day she agreed to be his partner, she had seen him following her to the open house. Benson asks why she didn't call the cops. Phillips reveals that she did, but they blew her off because she would have to say she was afraid for her life or that he was threatening her, and here he was offering her a job. Stabler adds that $150,000 a year, tax-free, must have taken the edge off her fear. She admits that she used his code to open his lock box that day as an alibi for him in the Fitzgerald case. Benson asks why she did that knowing his history from the court case. Phillips said he threatened to kill her if she told, and she really believed he would.The detectives get a warrant for Richard White's apartment. The search reveals such items as a map of Central Park with times and locations marked which incriminate him and his stalking behavior against Fitzgerald. A photo of Louise Billings is in the freezer, and a pad is taken to reveal the impressions left from previous notes. The empty hangers in the closet and the lack of food lead the detectives to believe that White has skipped town. Back at the station house, Munch warns Benson that she may be in White's sights since she squared off against him in the interrogation room. He tells her that the whole squad has her back. He leaves as Stabler enters. Stabler tells Benson that they were able to pull some of the impressions off the pad – a grocery store, gym, laundromat, pharmacist…he says they called them all to see if White frequented any of them. He didn't. It turns out the all of the locations were the locations where Benson did business. White had been stalking her.The next morning, Stabler drops by Benson's apartment to ask if she needs a lift to work. Benson says she knows what Stabler is up to, and for all she knows, White has left town. Next, the detectives are called to Billings' apartment. Louise, who had filed the rape charges against White, had been murdered in her apartment. A neighbor had heard the commotion and caught a glimpse of the guy through his peep hole. He immediately identified White in the photo lineup. Cragen gives all the detectives assignments, but tells Benson he doesn't want her on the street today. Benson insists and Cragen relents. Just then, a huge floral delivery arrives for Benson. The card reads: 'No hard feelings'. The detectives head to the floral shop and find that the arrangement was charged to the card of a Lila White. They get the address and go to Mrs. White's apartment. The woman is Richard White's wealthy mother. She says he had come home around 9am looking harried and disheveled and wanting to borrow money. She said he's a taker just like his father was, and she's prodded him to take control. Mrs. White says that Richard said he was going back to Manhatten to see a lady friend – some police woman. Stabler drops Benson off at her apartment for the evening.Benson is awakened by the phone. Richard White is on the other end asking for a meeting. He tells her to be at the park bench at 7am and to arrive alone. She tells him not to be late. The next morning, Benson arrives at the designated location as planned. As a woman and man are jogging toward the bench, the woman screams as the man pushes her out of the way revealing the knife he had poised on her. He immediately puts the knife to Benson's throat just as the entire SVU squad jumps out from behind bushes, ambushes the guy, and Benson cuffs him.Back at the station, Benson tells Stabler and Cragen that White wants to confess, but he also wants to play her reactions while he's doing it. Stabler reminds her that he has to confess to using the gun. Benson goes in to interrogate White. He asks about Benson's mother, Serena, and wants to know if she still carries the scars from her rape. He tells how he attacked Fitzgerald, but never cops to murdering his victims with a gun. He laughs and says he'll never get the death penalty, and he'll always be in Benson's head until he is dead. White then looks up at the interrogation window which Stabler is standing behind. White smirks and says, 'Detective Stabler, how are Kathy and the kids?'

Perry|1|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/stocks-and-bondage-12334/recap|http://www.tv.com|When Benson and Stabler arrive at the crime scene, they see a woman hanging from a rope anchored to the ceiling fan. They are informed the first thought was the victim, Layla Briggs, killed herself. They are assured they were notified as soon as the cause of death became questionable. While the team is discussing the link between tattoos and S&M, Cragen questions Benson's leaving part of her report blank. She informs him the first cause of death was suicide, but it did not add up. Stabler tells him the ME on the scene was a rookie and he disturbed the scene so they still need more information. He also suggests this may be a case of rough sex going too far. Benson tells them she was pierced from head to toe and she was a financial analyst. After Munch goes off on a rant about the link between high finance and S&M, Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to talk with the family while Munch and Cassidy check out her place of employment.Anne Briggs tells Benson and Stabler that Layla's father died when she was fifteen and since then they had drifted apart. Shortly after his death, she saw Layla had pierced both of her nipples. She decided that she may make it worse if she threw a fit about it so she never said anything. Layla kept her at arm's length never speaking  about anything personal. She last spoke with Layla a week prior and she was happy.Amy, the office manager where Layla worked, explained Layla's job to Munch and Cassidy. She explained even though Layla handled billions of dollars, she was well liked by all. She tells them Sho-Ling Fu had the most contact with Layla, but she is not in. When they ask for contact information for her, Amy tells them they frown on incoming personal calls. Munch explains the police frown on obstruction of justice.Rodgers confirms the cause of death is from a ligature around the neck. She refuses to declare homicide or suicide until Benson and Stabler give her some information. When Stabler questions whether the fatal injury was self-inflicted, Rodgers explains the robe she was wearing was clean meaning someone redressed her and that is the pattern of behavior for family.Benson and Stabler talk with Mrs. Briggs to see if maybe she found Layla. Stabler explains Layla may have been experimenting sexually. Benson tells her if that was the case her death could be an accident. Stabler pleads with her to help them. Mrs. Briggs explains she found Layla dressed in leather, she changed her, then called the police. She tells them she threw the stuff away in the dumpster in a blue plastic bag. Forensics shows Benson and Stabler the outfit Layla was wearing. Semen was found in the right places. He explains that even though there was a whip it was not used. When they heard the rattling from the end of the whip, they open it to find diamonds.As Munch is telling the team the cause of death was auto erotic asphyxiation, or terminal sex, Stabler and Benson interrupt to tell them the victim had a partner. When Stabler tells them they found half a million dollars in diamonds, Cragen sends them out to find out where it came from. Before they leave Stabler hands Cragen a file containing the victims credit card statements detailing which sex fetish shops she frequented. Cragen hands the file to Cassidy and Munch with orders to see if they can identify any of her partners.Munch and Cassidy find the clerk at a fetish shop explained to Layla about code words and general safety practices. The clerk also told them Layla came in with her boss's brunette girlfriend.Benson and Stabler learn only dealers and thieves deal in high quantities of diamonds, because diamonds are untraceable. They are sent to a dealer who will sell to anyone, David McKuin. He acknowledges he sold Layla 9,416,000 for her work. He tells them she wanted 10 million but he did not have that much. She paid with a corporate check from Martin Global signed by Sho-Ling Fu. Stabler tells him if anyone tries to fence a large quantity of diamonds to call him.When they arrive at Martin Global, Stabler informs Benson that Munch just informed him Martin has two stunning girlfriends. They first speak with Sho-Ling Fu. She tells them Layla sometimes dealt with the delivery of actual goods, but she does not know where the diamonds in question are. Their next stop is Mr. Martin's office where they find him working on repairing a computer. When they inform him Layla had purchased sex stuff on the corporate credit card, he compares it to financing a drinking habit. He explains the diamonds as a financial move and anyone who knows how to read the financial report would know she had the diamonds. He tells them everyone in the office has access to the report as well as the New Vision Endowment.At the New Vision Endowment, they learn the endowment was constantly put at risk. They were also told Frank Martin was given power of attorney and if anything happened he would cover them. They return to Martin to discuss this new information with him. He tells them it was a financial move. He tells them Layla made millions working for him and she did not have a reason to steal anything. He does not know of her having any problems with him, nor does he know who she is dating.When Cragen asks for an update, Benson and Stabler inform him Layla purchased sex toys with corporate credit cards and everyone knew about it. They also tell him she was a financial whiz and managed a fund for a charity. Cragen tells them a charity's financial records are public record and he wants to know what they were really doing with it.After looking at the financial records they notice only $1 million of the $18 million taken in actually went for charity. When they confront David Kelp, the director of the charity, they explain they believe Layla embezzles the money, he signs the reports, and Layla got greedy. He tells them he and Layla knew each other because of their compulsions and he was threatened to keep quiet about the financial irregularities or she would expose his. He tells them Anna Foust knew Layla real well.Foust tells them Layla and Frank Martin were banished from her parties because Frank hurt one of the girls. She agrees to tell them the identity of the girl only if they agree to punish him.When Cragen talks to the girl, she tells him Martin threatened to turn her into Immigration unless she played some games with him. Martin wanted to try choking her. He promised her it would be okay. He wrapped a belt around her neck until she passed out. When she came to, he was gone.When the team goes to search Martin's office, they walk in to a pile of shredded documents and nothing else. Cragen informs the team the FBI is only interested in the financial side of things. When he asks for ideas on how to find him, Benson suggests to follow the money, which happens to be $9 million in diamonds. Cragen tells them to check the diamond district. Jeffries comes in loaded down with files and tells them she found out the Tennessee Department of Commerce is investigating him. They even went so far as to send an investigator to New York.The investigator, Tucker,  informs Benson and Stabler everything Martin does is barely legitimate. After five months of investigating, he has found aggressive maneuvers, but nothing solid. He gives them all of the contacts he knows of. As they leave Benson tells him Munch just told her McKuin received a call from a woman wanting to unload a bunch of diamonds. Munch acts as a diamond dealer when Sho-Ling Fu shows up to get rid of the diamonds. Munch and Cassidy escort her to the station for further questioning, but she refuses to talk. While Munch and Cassidy are doing all of the talking, Munch looks in her calendar to find she had lots of date with David Kelp. Munch bails to go see his Phrenologist. When Stabler and Benson go to speak with Kelp, they find his body. They return to the station to talk to Sho-Ling Fu. They inform her Kelp had a bullet hole through his head. She tells them Martin told her to cash the diamonds out and if she went to the cops or did not return, he would kill Kelp. She tells them where to find Martin. When they go to the location to bust Martin, they bust the door in and find Tucker.Benson and Stabler question Tucker about Martin's location. He denies knowing where Martin is, but when they threaten to charge him with Layla's murder, he tells them Martin left an hour before they arrived. When they ask him what happened with Layla, he tells them he does not know specifics. Martin called him and when he arrived Martin already had her strung up. He expected to join Martin and Layla in another erotic sex night. He tells them in return he got cash, cars, and free time. He refused to help Martin cover it up, but he gave him diamonds to shut him up. The only person Martin still trusted was Amy. When they get to her place, they find her badly beaten up. She tells them Martin beat her when she told him she did not have any money, but he located an old airline ticket. He forced her to call the airline and tell them she was an invalid and her friend was coming to change the ticket.Benson and Stabler meet up with Martin at the ticket counter when the ticket agent has problems getting his card to go through. They give him a lift to the station. They claim they are waiting to make sure he is authorized to use the platinum card. They tell him they are investigative bean counters. When they begin asking questions about what Tucker had told them, Martin is reduced to asking one word questions before asking for his lawyer.Amy tells Cragen she met Martin in a bar she and her friend used to go to try to get jobs from the sloshed executives. He tried to get her into his sex games, but when she did not get into the extremes he got tired of her. He told her when he was a teen, he and Tucker used to tie 'colored girls' up to trees and watch them struggle, but let them go instead of letting them die. When Cragen asks about Layla, she pulls out a stack of papers and gives them to Cragen.Benson and Stabler question Martin. After he drops his CEO demeanor, they tell him Sho-Ling and Amy turned him in. He tells them Tucker is the one that strangled Layla because he liked seeing how far he could go.Munch and Cassidy question Tucker. When Tucker tells them what he did to the girls in Tennessee happened when he was a minor and that was how it was then. When he adds 'It broke the boredom,' Jeffries slings the door open and asks if it broke the boredom of sitting on a porch them eating watermelon and having babies. She informs him she is a detective who just came in to look at the redneck of the New South. Before she walks out the door, she adds that Martin rolled on him. Munch explains that if he would like to give a statement the DA might consider a plea bargain. When he asks Cassidy to clarify, he tells him he and Frank are going to hang.
Steve Wertimer|10|10|2000-01-07 00:00:00|E0915|Closure (Part I)||Wendy West|1|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/closure-12335/recap|http://www.tv.com|A freshly showered and smoking Harper Anderson calls 911 telling the operator she has been raped. While Cassidy and Benson are in bed together, her pager goes off alerting her it is time for her to go to work. As she walks into the other room, Cassidy tells her the sex was incredible. Her only response was for him to not get used to it.When Benson arrives at the hospital, she must give a description of the rape victim she needs to see. Harper overhears the conversation and speaks up. Harper informs her she sent the uniform officer to the cafeteria because he was getting on her nerves. Benson explains she needs a description of the attack before they can do the rape exam. Harper tells her the perp grabbed her ankles and wrists before hitting her in the face. After penetrating her vaginally, he ejaculated on her stomach only to wipe it off with one of her t-shirts. He made her shower. Benson excuses herself to approach a nearby doctor. She informs him that since the victims from the car wreck are stable then he will do a rape exam next. As they near the end of the exam, Benson goes through the checklist of evidence needed. When Benson tells the doctor they need to do a UV on her stomach to check for fluids, he informs her the hospital does not have one. Benson concedes that it would not do any good since he made her shower after Harper groans. The doctor gives her a high dose contraceptive telling her to take two more in twelve hours. He informs her the STD test results will be back in 24 hours, but she will need to retest in three and six months. When she asks what is next, Benson tells her they can go to the station so she can give her formal statement if she is up to it. In the hallway, the doctor tells Stabler to perp used as little force as possible and made sure to erase as much of the DNA as possible. When they are interrupted by a uniform officer asking if they heard about the rape victim causing the doctor to leave. When Stabler confirms his suspicion this was the officer who left the victim alone, he tells him to never leave a rape victim alone. The officer tells him the crime scene is secure, but they still need to know what to look for. Stabler tells him they are about to go find out before making sure he can handle voucher the rape kit.At the station, Harper tells Benson and Stabler what happened. She wore earplugs because of the street fair on her street. She woke up to a man holding her shirt. He held her legs closed by jamming his knees on either side of her. He pulled her nightgown up shielding her face and capturing her arms. When she jerked away at his attempt to kiss her, he hit her in the face. He unzipped his pants, thrusts hard five times, and asked, 'Is this how you like it?' He ejaculated on her stomach, wiped it off with her shirt, and told her to take a shower adding 'Please'. He made sure the water temperature was right before taking her gown off so she could see to get in the shower. He carefully washed her completely, handed her a towel and her robe before telling her to get on the floor and count to twenty. He even told her he was not going to insult her by asking her not to call the police. She describes the perp as being tall, thin, white, sandy hair, cold eyes, and he was about her age. She informs them nothing out of the ordinary had happened to tip her off that this may happen. He was not nervous. He smelled like expensive, subtle cologne. She tells them she is positive she can identify the perp in a line-up. She draws a picture of the ring he stole explaining it is platinum, rare, and belonged to her grandmother. He also stole her wallet and the t-shirt he used to clean her off. When Benson takes her to her boyfriend's apartment, she explains a locksmith will change the locks in her apartment and a counselor will call her to set up an appointment. Giving her a business card with her pager number on it, she tells Harper to call her anytime. Before she walks away, they exchange a smile.Benson notices Cassidy's presence as soon as she enters Harper's apartment. Stabler quickly explains he called him in case she stayed longer with Harper. After they inform her they did not find any prints, Cassidy informs her the perp came in through the window. Stabler shows her the lock on the window has been broken for a while. He further explains the perp came in and saw her sleeping before heading over to the dresser where he takes the t-shirt and her wallet...but who smoked the joint? He immobilizes her, rapes her, and takes her ring. Since they did not find underwear, they assume the perp took them as a trophy. He takes her to the shower. Benson notes the wet shower curtain while Cassidy says the soap is not wet leading him to believe she staged the whole thing. Upon seeing the curling iron on the floor, he demonstrates it could have been the gun used. Stabler questions the lack of evidence while Cassidy believes Harper was paranoid. When Benson asks Cassidy is he wants to hear that she said it never happened, he responds that maybe that is the truth.Cragen interrupts a discussion between Cassidy and Benson to get the team update going. When Stabler informs them the perp gained access to the apartment using the fire escape at the window, they agree it must have been a stranger and rule out the tenants of the building. There were no fingerprints or DNA evidence. After Benson relays the description of the perp, Stabler adds since she was hit on the left side of the face then he must be right-handed. Cragen comes to the realization the perp is not a junkie because of the cologne he wears. Since he took the time to make sure there was not any evidence, they conclude the attack was planned. The decide to rule out the Upper West Side perp since this one talked to his victim. Stabler explains the perp asked  Harper 'Is this how you like it?' and said  'Please' making the perp think he was being a gentleman. After Cragen remembers the street fair going on where Harper lived, Cassidy tells him her will check out the vendors. Munch says he will check the pawn shops for the leafy ring. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to ask Harper about the joint and to question Harper's neighbors.When they arrive at Benji Dowe's apartment looking for Harper, Benson informs him that Harper needs his unconditional love and acceptance. Dowe informs them Harper went to work after not being able to sleep. Upon meeting up with Harper at Le Poeme, Harper questions  Benson and Stabler's reasoning for asking about the joint. After they tell her it is a routine question, she reminds them nothing about that night was routine for her.  The superintendent of Harper's building tells Benson and Stabler there have not been any break-ins or unusual people around the building. He tells them he will ask the tenants and he may lose some over the attack. One of the tenants sitting at her window informs them of a 'Peeping Tom' in the building across the street. Benson and Stabler find the 'Peeping Tom,' Sam Lardner, has three charges of assault on his record. Stabler wonders if this makes number four. At first when asked about Harper, he tells them he denies knowing her. After describing the apartment was and telling him the wrong apartment, he quickly corrects the mistake. Lardner informs him he saw the entire rape before telling them everything that happened. He also gives them the information that Harper does not wear underwear to bed, but tells them he did not see the guy's face because he was too busy looking at Harper.In the squad room, Jeffries informs Benson and Stabler she checked Harper's usual places and found several attacks. While Jeffries is telling them none of the MO's matched, Cragen interrupts them asking if Harper would buy $500 of meats at one time. After they tell him someone is using her credit card, he informs them Munch and Cassidy are transporting him from the 27th Precinct. As they escort the perp in, Cassidy stops Benson to return the watch she left at his apartment and to ask he rout again. When she turns him down, he believes she was only refusing because of the incident at Harper's apartment. Before the conversation is over, she informs him the night was a one time only occasion. While Benson and Stabler are at their lockers, Stabler asks about her relationship with Cassidy. After initially denying it, she tells him she broke a personal rule and now she is paying the price for it because Cassidy wants to see her again. He reminds her he is her partner for better or worse and advises her to be over nice to Cassidy and he will get over it.Before going into the interrogation room, Benson, Stabler, and Cragen discuss the perp's rap sheet. His robbery charges escalates from shoplifting to breaking and entering to rape. Stabler guesses he escalated out of boredom or the opportunity arose. Benson informs him Harper is on her way to make a positive identification since he matches the description of her attacker.After making the perp account for his morning, Benson and Stabler question him about how he used his time the night before. He informs them he was in a holding cell after jumping a turn  While Stabler works on his computer, Benson looks at a print out of arraignments and tells Cragen the guy is not on the list. After asking when she got the print out, Cragen reminds them the list is only updated once a day. Stabler quickly types on the computer and locates the newly posted arraignment. Cragen excuses himself to work on paperwork before Harper comes into the squad room. Benson approaches her stating they did not have the perp after all. She retrieves Harper's new apartment keys from her desk and gives them to her. Six months later. When Cassidy sees Benson getting ready for a date, he reminds her she was not ready for a relationship six months ago. She reminds him that falling for someone you work with is not a smart choice. He tells her that if she still works there when she gets married, then her marriage will be an affair because she is married to the job. They are interrupted when Cragen calls Benson into his office. When Benson enters the office, Cragen introduces her to Detective Halligan from Robbery. Cragen relays to her the details of a 4-day-old robbery case. He explains the perp entered the apartment through the window while he was wearing a mask. The perp was using a gun, being polite, and the victim had a gun under her mattress. When she flipped the light on, the gun he had was a curling iron. Benson informs Halligan of Harper's case. Halligan tells her the guy limped away after the victim froze up. After glancing over the file, Benson tells them she believes this is Harper's guy. Cragen tells her to interview Jane Tyler to make sure the MO matches before she does anything else. When he tells her it can wait, she tells him she doubts Jane is sleeping and leaves.While Jane tells Benson what happened to her, she adds the perp stole her father's watch. The watch had 'Leo' inscribed on the back. She also tells her he raped her. After talking a little longer, Benson draws the similarities with Harper's attack. Jane explains she did not tell the police everything because she wanted them out of her apartment. Benson tells her she did the one thing she was suppose to do...survive.Stabler questions the address of the suspect as they arrive. Mrs. Cleary answers the door and calls for her husband when asked. Benson promptly notices Harper's ring her finger drawing Stabler's attention to it as well. They escort Cleary to the precinct to question him.Cleary explains his limp is due to an accidental step off of the curb. He states he was on Lennox Street clearing his head over some stressful clients. His wife buys his cologne so he does not know the name of it. He bought the ring off of the street from a guy named T.J. After he says his watch has been in the family for years, Benson asks to see it. She immediately looks on the back to see 'Leo'. When she asks who Leo is, he states it is his astrological sign. He tells them T.J. can be found between Canal and Mott. Stabler explains Canal and Mott intersect so you cannot be between the two, but to help him understand he asks Cleary to draw a diagram showing T.J.'s location.While updating Cragen on the case, Benson informs him Cleary smells expensive. Cragen mocks her saying the jury should smell the defendant. After Stabler laughs at the comment, he explains not many perps shop for expensive cologne and the watch and ring are trophies from the rapes. Cragen reminds them they will not reopen Jane's case. Cragen informs them they can get Cleary on possession of stolen property, but they need Harper to identify the ring. Benson tells him Harper said she could identify her rapist as well. Cragen reminds them they have until 9AM to get him arraigned.When they arrive at Harper's apartment, the superintendent answers the door explaining Harper never stayed there again. He tells them he knew he would not be able to rent the apartment to anyone else so he moved into it. He informs them she moved out so fast he still has her deposit.   When they check with Dowe, he tells them Harper stopped eating. She could not sleep unless the lights were on, which meant he could not sleep. She worked out like a fiend. She started dressing differently and even wore her tennis shoes to bed. After he tells them she broke up with him three months prior, he explains Harper changed addresses, changed jobs, and created a whole new Harper.They finally arrive at Harper's apartment. She tells them to never come back and slams the door in their faces.In Cragen's office, he explains to ADA Carmichael Cleary's wife keeps saying Cleary sleeps through the night. Benson asks if they can get a search warrant to look for other trophies in Cleary's home. She is reminded they only have one victim. When she asks about using some law Harper has broken to compel her to talk, ADA Carmichael explains she is not going to rape her a second time. ADA Carmichael tells her she will have to use her own powers of persuasion with Harper. After ADA Carmichael leaves, Cragen informs Benson that Stabler is digging up anything he can on Cleary and Munch is working on Cleary's lawyer. He tells her to take Cassidy with a photo array and show it to Harper. Before she gets out the door, he reminds her they only have a few hours left before they must let Cleary go. While Cleary tries to explain aggressive accounting to Munch, Stabler comes in to explain Cleary is a Cancer not a Leo. He tells him Leo was a nickname of his grandfather's. Stabler questions that considering his grandfather's name was Percy. When Cleary tries to continue his explanation with Munch, Stabler tries to ask Cleary if he gets to Tribeca a lot before being cut off by Cleary's lawyer telling him he does not have to answer that. After Stabler is told Cleary can only answer questions about what is public record, Cleary's lawyer asks what he is being charged with. Munch responds telling Stabler he does not have to answer that.When Harper refuses to answer her door, Benson tells her she is just as stubborn as she is causing Harper to answer the door. Benson and Cassidy explain her attacker has attacked again and she is the only one who can identify him. Harper tells them she did everything she could and she is over it. When Harper walks away, Cassidy regains her attention when he tells Benson that maybe the guy they have did not do her. Harper turns around and corrects his statement angrily. Benson cuts in reminding Harper she is still sleeping in her tennis shoes so she is not over it. She informs her '[c]losure is a myth'. Benson explains people change everyday and you can accept them or fight them. When Harper refuses to come in to help herself, Benson asks her to come for them promising she will be there with her. At the precinct, Harper is unable to identify her rapist even after they all say, 'Is this how you like it?' Benson takes her back to her desk and shows her the ring. Benson informs her they retrieved it from a man she could not identify. Harper breaks down realizing she really could not identify her rapist. She explains believed since her mother died a long, horrible death that nothing else bad could ever happen to her.

The officer identifies the victim as Seth Langdon, the only occupant of a two bedroom on the sixth floor of the building. He explains Seth is the son William H. Langdon, head of the Moral Coalition. He reminds them Seth's father preaches about good clean living and believes homosexuality can be cured.Munch walks in to the team filling out forms for new medical coverage. As he rants about the invasion of privacy, he passes Benson's desk. He tells everyone she has the right idea by leaving the father's section blank causing Stabler to tell him to keep his eyes on his own paper. Cragen breaks it up by asking for information on the case. Benson and Stabler explain the white victim was 21-year-old Seth Langdon who was a resident attending a party in the building until he went to the roof around 1AM. They explain seminal fluids were found on the body and his genitals were left exposed. He was badly beaten culminating in his head being hit against the AC unit. Munch guesses lover's quarrel. Jeffries guesses it was a sexual predator from the party. Cassidy informs them the ME found two sets of DNA...the victim and the doer. Cragen tells them to start working their way through the guest list. When Munch notices the victim's name, he starts talking about William H. Langdon, but it interrupted by Stabler informing him of the victim's relationship to him. When Cassidy expresses his disbelief, Cragen informs them one out of ten men are gay and tells them to see how he felt about it hitting that close to home. Once Stabler sees Cragen leave, he approaches Munch at the coffee pot. Stabler warns him about comments about Benson's father before explaining her father was the man who raped her mother.Benson and Stabler arrive to see William H. Langdon, but are stopped by Steven Hale only to be allowed in when Mr. Langdon sees them. He denies his son's homosexuality saying they had it under control. When he says homosexuality is a crime against God, Stabler asks if AIDS is divine retribution. Benson explains their only agenda is to find his son's killer. Mr. Langdon explains his son went through sexual rehabilitation centers and completed it two months prior.When Munch and Cassidy question the hosts of the party, they are told the party goers were of the elite. They tell them the party was a civilized gathering. Seth arrived with a blond gentleman, but after a few drinks his date wanted to leave. They exchanged words in the hallway before Seth returned alone, retrieved another drink, and went to the balcony. Benson and Stabler speak with Lorraine Hansen. She tells them she heard yelling from the roof before a beer bottle came crashing to the sidewalk. When her husband, Jesse, arrives, he tells them he went to tell the party hosts to turn the music down. Lorraine tells them she saw a blonde guy getting into a chauffeur driven Lincoln Town car.In the squad room, Munch approaches Benson as she is inputting the party guests into the computer. He explains he did not know about her father. She tells him Stabler and Cragen are the only ones to know and she does not want anyone else to find out. He promises to keep his mouth shut before asking if they ever caught him. After she tells him no, he offers her his ear if she ever needs to talk. Stabler interrupts them explaining the car service used at Seth's building told him the occupant Steven Hale was dropped of at a brownstone in the Upper East Side.As Benson and Stabler approach Hale outside his home, they ask if Mr. Langdon knew what he did to his son. They are interrupted by his wife and son coming down the stairs.In the squad room while they watch Steven Hale stew in the interrogation room, Munch questions why a gay man would work for Mr. Langdon. After Stabler explains the witnesses saw Hale get jealous when he saw Seth hitting on other guys, Benson wonders if Hale thought that by working for Langdon would cure him of his homosexuality. Stabler adds the example of Mr. Langdon believing Camp Wild Bunch could cure Seth. Stabler and Benson question how educated people could think people would choose family rejection and discrimination and heartache to be gay. Munch tells them one of the treatments at the sexual rehabilitation places is electroshock therapy to the groin. Benson brings them back to Hale pointing out he is fuming. Stabler reminds her they just caught him in the lie he has been living so of course he will be mad. When Munch points out Hale is mad at them, they explain that is why they want him to speak with him since he is so smart and patient.Before Munch can say a word, Hale tells him he is not a homosexual. He explains his job is to keep an eye on Seth since his father is considering a run for Congress and an openly homosexual son could ruin it like Newt's lesbian sister did him. Munch clarifies Newt's sister was actually his half-sister before asking him if he thinks Newt's problems could have anything to do with his ethics violations. While he is ranting, Cragen calls for Cassidy to take over. Hale explains to Cassidy he followed Seth to the party. He was upset by Seth's flirting because he found it revolting. He further explains the statement 'Stay out of my life' was a message Seth wanted Hale to deliver to his father.After explaining Hale's wife alibi's him after 12:30AM and Seth's journal confirms he was not involved with Hale, Cragen tells Benson and Stabler to send Hale home with their apologies. When Stabler explains he checked the guest list with Seth's journal and found nothing, Cragen looks at the list noting it contained assemblymen, people from the social register, and a major AIDS fund-raiser. He tells them to check them all regardless of social standing. Jeffries and Cassidy interrupt Andre Lasnik's rehearsal stating they are investigating a homicide. After explaining he left the party after one, he told them when Seth came on to him he excused himself to the restroom. He informs them Assemblyman Rossi's boyfriend, Joe Bandolini, had a camcorder at the party.Benson and Stabler approach Officer Bandolini's patrol car asking to speak to him in private. Once out of earshot of his partner, Bandolini informs them he knows they want to talk about the Langdon case. He tells them his tape was made of the party, not the murder. He assures them it contains nothing relevant to the case. They promise they will keep his reputation intact. When they ask if they can see it to make sure it does not have any leads for them, he tells them he will bring it to their squad room in the morning.Munch goes to the 55th precinct and speaks with a detective who worked with Conklin. The detective explains Conklin kept most of his notes in his head. Upon glancing through Conklin's notebook, he sees the notes on Serena Benson's case and asks what 'C.K'. stood for. The detective explains that it was '68 so it was Carl Kudlak. He further explains they pulled him in on a lot of cases then but could not nail him on any until his wife killed herself in '72 taking his alibi with her. Stabler reports to Cragen's office upon his request. Cragen introduces him to Mr. Shore, Bandolini's GOAL representative. After Stabler questions involving the Gay Officer's Action League, Mr. Shore explains that since he and Benson harassed the officer then they must step in. Stabler explains they did not harass him, but asked for a tape they may need in their case. Mr. Shore claims they threatened Bandolini with legal action and public humiliation. When Cragen tries to calm the situation saying they can work this out, Mr. Shore explains he has seen the tape and agrees with Bandolini saying it does not contain anything they may need. He further explains that if Bandolini is outed by accident or on purpose they will be slapped with a defamation suit. Before he leaves, Mr. Shore hands Cragen an injunction barring them from seizing the tape. Cragen tells Stabler to get Benson in there.Munch tells Benson he had some free time and pulled her mother's case. While she tries to explain she has pulled everything there is to pull, he hands her a file and tells her she would not have been able to pull this. He explains this guy looked good for her mother's rape. Stabler interrupts them asking Munch if he is bothering his partner. They both deny he is bothering her as she puts the file in a drawer and returns to work.When Forensics tells Benson and Stabler they ran the quickest DNA tests available and got a hit, Stabler demands a name. After she tells him it will not hold up in court, she gives them the name Ray Gunther. Stabler wonders where he knows the name from. Benson explains they studied about him in the academy. She reminds him Gunther went around terrorizing women in the early '80s and was tagged 'The Parkway Rapist'.In the squad room, Jeffries goes off about Gunther being let out. Stabler informs them if Gunther escaped then he took the entire administrative staff of Sing-Sing with him because she has been on hold for ten minutes. They are interrupted when Cragen comes out of his office to explain Gunther was paroled one month prior after serving 15 of his 25-year term citing the overcrowding in the prisons as the reason for letting him out early. When Benson and Jeffries express their distaste of the decision to let this guy out, Stabler attempts to calm them reminding them he had to register. Cragen tells him his address is in Seth's building. When Benson and Stabler knock on the door where Gunther is supposed to be staying, Jesse Hansen answers. Benson tells them they are close when Lorraine asks if they found the guy that killed Seth. When they are told Ray Gunther gave that address when he was paroled, Jesse explains Ray is his brother.In the interrogation room, Benson and Stabler asks if Jesse changed his name because Gunther was not a popular name in his neighborhood. He tells them people gave him a hard time about his name. He denies knowing where Ray is.Lorraine explains to Munch and Cassidy that Jesse will never talk about Ray. When Ray was on trial, reporters came to his high school and Jesse told them Ray should be put to death. Because of this Jesse allowed him to stay with them after he got out, but she kicked him out after the first week. She tells them Ray was in their apartment until 1AM. He may be with Cindy Stocklash who will only stay at hotels with porn.Benson listens to the tape of her mother's statement while looking over the file and pictures. Serena explains she was on her way home from the campus library after it closed when she was knocked unconscious. When she regained consciousness, she was on a landing below street level and a man was on top of her. The only thing she could remember was he had sideburns. Benson stopped the tape when a car horn honked startling her.Munch and Cassidy approach the hotel room and hear moans and groans. They chuckle before knocking. When they receive a response, Munch announces they are detectives. They hear noises causing Cassidy to ask if everything is okay. As Ray climbs out the back window, he is apprehended by Benson and Stabler, who escort him to their car. They explain he is under arrest for Seth's murder. When he tells them they do not have proof, they inform him he left evidence in his mouth. The team explains he will look right for it with the jury. Out for one month and he is back to his old tricks changing from highways to rooftops, but using the same amount of excessive force. When Benson asks if he liked his victims puny, Ray asks if she is jealous. Stabler reacts to Ray's use of the word 'sweetheart' by squeezing the cuffs and bringing Ray to the ground while he reminds Ray her name is Detective Benson and demands an apology. Benson helps Stabler get him back to his feet and tells him she does not need an apology from him.When Cragen pulls Benson and Stabler into his office, Stabler begins his explanation of his treatment of Gunther. Cragen stops him to ask what he is talking about, but Benson cuts in inquiring as to what he wanted. Cragen informs them the DNA does not belong to Ray Gunther. When they arrive at the Forensics Lab, they are reminded they were told the results would not hold up in court. She goes on to explain that while the DNA did not belong to Ray, it does belong to a family member.Stabler enters the interrogation room telling Jesse the DNA lets Ray off the hook. They tell him a DNA sample could clear his name. He tells them he should call a lawyer, but they tell him he is free to go.Cassidy informs Jeffries and Munch that they had Ray dead to rights when he was tried before. Ray got on the stand and told the court he was abused by his father. When they called Jesse to the stand, Jesse denied it. Cragen tells Benson and Stabler they will get his DNA. When Cragen asks what they have, Jeffries tells him a piss poor gene pool. Stabler tells them your behavior is not predetermined. Cassidy tells them of twins being raised totally different, but turn out committing the same crime. Cragen informs them they have shown by transferring genes from one species to another can alter behavior. Stabler reminds them they are humans and it comes down to how you are raised. Benson gets upset and walks away. Stabler follows her wanting to see if anything is wrong. She tells him the only way Jesse and Ray make sense is if they are fruit from the same poisonous tree. When he questions if she truly believes that, she walks away from him.When ADA Carmichael brings up the fact Forensics led them to Jesse's brother first, Benson and Stabler explain it was because it was the same bloodline. She tells them they are asking if they are going to test everyone in the family. Benson tells her just the one who lives in the victim's building. Cragen clarifies another piece of evidence they have is tied up in litigation, but he will try to get it untied.Cragen meets Bandolini on a bench in town. He makes sure the officer knows they need the tape, but the officer makes sure he knows what it could do to him. After Cragen tells him a golf story and asks him how he is sleeping, Bandolini hands him the tape assuring him there is nothing illegal on the tape.Upon viewing the tape, Munch gives the tech a few instructions and locates Jesse not entering. After a few more instructions, they locate Ray. Stabler decides they need to talk to Lorraine again for clarification on when they each returned.  Stabler explains to Lorraine that providing a false alibi for someone is a felony. She denies Jesse's involvement explaining Ray has been hell-bent on ruining Jesse's life. She explains what she had told them was accurate, but after Jesse came home Ray took him back out. She tells them he did not return until two.Ray tells Benson and Stabler his involvement was a joke. He kept telling Jesse that Seth was his girlfriend. He also explains he would do the flirting with Seth for Jesse. When Jesse left, he told Seth to go on the roof and Jesse would be up there. Ray then explains that if Jesse had told the truth at his trial then he would have only received five years. Before they leave, Ray gloats that they cannot pin any of this on him no matter how much they want to. Benson and Stabler tell Jesse Ray told them everything. Jesse explains Ray told the truth at his trial, but he wanted to forget it all. He tells them Ray would tell him he would end up in jail. He does not remember how he got on the roof. He remembers someone was on their knees and his pants were down. Jesse tells them he could hear Ray laughing at him from the door. He tells them he thought he was killing Ray. When Seth was dead, Ray told him, 'Welcome to the family'. ADA Carmichael tells Cragen they can charge Ray with inciting a murder, depraved indifference, and accessory to start. She tells him with Ray's priors he will do more time than Jesse.When Stabler tries to explain Jesse did what he did not because it was in his blood, but because he believed it would. She retrieves a file from her desk saying there is something she needs to do. When he asks what good it will do for her to know, she just looks at him. Benson walks to where she can see the old man at the window. After looking for a few moments, she returns to the car saying she is positive he is not her father.

While Benson talks to Emily's mother, Stabler speaks with Emily. Her mother explains her son was at a bachelor's party in the Hamptons and hitched a ride home with them. Emily tells Stabler her dad wanted a divorce. Her mother tells Benson her husband would have sex with anything or anyone. When asked why someone would sodomize him with a banana, she explains he was allergic to them before excusing herself to call her son, Adam.In the squad room, Munch and Stabler agree on the fact that whoever used the banana knew he was allergic and may not have been trying to kill him since that would stop an allergic reaction. Benson does not understand why the wife stayed knowing about his extra activities, but she has an alibi which is confirmed by Emily, who Stabler does not believe would lie to protect her mother. Cassidy remains hung up on the guy in the photo. Jeffries tells them the widow and the kids share $100 million as a result of Andrew Harlin's death. Cragen tells Jeffries to pull all of Harlin's records, bills, and such. He sends Benson and Stabler to talk with the son. Cragen tells them he wants to reconstruct the family's affairs.Munch and Cassidy question 'Bull Dozier' (the guy in the photo) while he loads a moving van. He tells them he ended his relationship with Andrew when he did not pay for the last 7 dinners, all he wanted was sex and they both wanted to be on top. He shows them the bondage paraphernalia Andrew loaned him and asked if his wife wanted them returned. Munch told him she probably will not miss them.When Benson and Stabler talk with Adam, they learn the trip with his mother was enough for him to last for three years. He informs them he had a good relationship with his father until he started sleeping with his girlfriends. The last one being Becky Sorenson. When they talk with Sorenson, she sounds like Andrew was God's gift to women. She tells them the relationship only lasted two weeks, but ended on a good note. When they show her pictures of men Andrew had been with, she recognizes Charlie, the one with the boat. Charlie tries to deny the relationship, but finally concedes that he let Andrew have sex with him in exchange for help with his child's tuition for school. He is shocked to learn he was not the only guy Andrew had been with like he had been told.In the team meeting, Benson and Stabler inform them Andrew had no angry break ups and no one with a motive. Munch informs them he spent more money on girls than boys. Jeffries tells them a fingerprint lifted from the scene belongs to Sonya Pietrovicz. She has been in the states for 3 years and lists her occupation in Russian, but it translates as 'hooker'.Benson and Stabler go to The Turkish Baths in search of Sonya. They are told she left a few weeks prior to be with Victor, who owns Ecstacy. He also explains that in Russia hookers are at the top of the social scene. They rarely fall in love. In America, girls fall in love so easily. When they see a guy in the Jacuzzi, Benson and Stabler recognize him but cannot place him.At Ecstasy Spa, Benson and Stabler learn Sonya no longer works there, but her friend Natasha does. Natasha tells Benson about Sonya's new boyfriend Yuri. She also tells her they are not friends any more because she met too many men. Natasha and Sonya auditioned for the same singing job. Natasha believes Sonya only got the job because she was sleeping with Yuri.Benson and Stabler talk with Sonya after a performance. When they tell her fingerprints were fond on the bondage supplies used to kill Harlin belong to her, she tells them she cleaned his house as a favor to her friend Katya, who is on vacation. When they threaten to arrest her, she says she thinks Katya slept with Andrew once. They tell her to get word to Katya that they want to talk to her.While they are sitting around the squad room discussing Russia and women, Jeffries answers a call. When she hangs up, she tells the team that it was Harlin's housekeeper who is not on vacation and her name is not Katya. They decide to bring Sonya in for questioning. She informs them it is exciting to do something forbidden. And her job is forbidden. She tells them her only commitment is to her friends. After she denies knowing the identity of Katya's boyfriend, Cragen interrupts them to tell Stabler Emily needs to speak with him. Emily tells him she retrieved her father's personal papers from his hiding place. Among the papers were some legal papers telling of a lawsuit he had going against Katya. When Stabler informs Cragen Andrew was suing Katya for $2 million, Cragen tells them that was a good motive. Benson tells him that was the value of the gifts Katya kept. Stabler informs him the lawsuit was dropped the day after Andrew died. Emily also told him her mother may know where Katya is because she used to hear her parents arguing over Andrew paying for her apartment. Cragen sends them on their way to talk to the widow.Mrs. Harlin says she believed they already knew about the suit. She also tells Benson and Stabler she is sure there were more Russians that Andrew slept with. Adam interrupts to tell them he told his mother to drop the lawsuit. When they ask her if she has an address for Katya, she tells them to ask her lawyer.Someone calls Cragen speaking Russian so he gets Munch to take the call. Munch tells Cragen and Cassidy it was Sonya, she said she was on Brighten Beach, and she sounded scared. When they get to the apartment building an elderly lady is scrubbing the stairs. When they open the door, they see Sonya and another woman laying dead on the floor.Benson and Stabler join Cassidy and Munch outside the apartment building. A uniform officer brings a Russian man over to them and says he is Sonya's cousin. While the guy speaks in Russian, Munch relays to the others that he is inviting them to his restaurant to drink and talk. At the restaurant, he tells them the other woman was Sonya's aunt. He shows them a picture of Sonya and her friends. When they show him a picture of a guy, he tells them they do not bring their American boyfriends around him.While they are talking about a possible motive for the deaths of these women, they are interrupted by Alexander Strizhov. He tells them there is no need to find Katya because he killed Harlin. He tells them he was shot, but he was not murdered that way. When told about Sonya's death, he is shocked by the news, but he keeps telling them to arrest him. Cragen, Benson, and Stabler decide he is lying possibly to cover for Katya. They decide to go look for Katya at her apartment.The doorman tells them she left an hour prior in her car service very dressed up. When they finally locate her, she comes on to Stabler. He informs her Sonya is dead, but she already knows. She believes she should go on with her life. When they ask her to join them at the station, she tells them unless she is under arrest she will not go. They agree to let her come to the station at 9AM, but if she does not show they promise to have immigration show up at 9:05.The next morning, they inform Katya Alexander confessed to Andrew's murder. She tells them they went to Andrew's to tease him. She told him she left him because she caught him with two men. She denies killing Andrew, but admits to putting the banana in his tailpipe.When they update Cragen on their interview with Katya, Stabler guesses that since Harlin liked living on the edge that may have included sleeping with a mobster's girlfriend. Cragen sends them to Sonya's boyfriend's restaurant.When they get there, they are invited to join the table of Sonya's boyfriend. When Benson refuses to dance, she is told she must wait. Stabler is told Sonya made bad choices when it came to the men she chose to hang around with, like Alexander. When Stabler asks if he is trying to say Alex killed her or Andrew, he says they are just having a friendly conversation.While Munch and Cassidy are questioning the locals at Brighton Beach, they see Sonya's cousin. He is drunk and speaking English. He tells them he heard an argument between Sonya and Alex. He hears banging around and then Alex kills her.Stabler informs Katya that they know Alex killed Sonya and they think he killed Andrew. Stabler tells her Sonya and Alex were sleeping together. She tells him that she and Alex used to sleep together. Benson asks to speak with her alone. When Stabler leaves, Benson tells her it would be easy to convict her of Andrew's murder. Benson tells her if she is not guilty, then help them convict Alex. When she tells Benson she is too busy, Benson asks her if she is a sex machine with a cash register between her legs or if she is too scared to get involved. When Benson tells her the prisons in America are no different than the ones in Russia, Katya does not believe her. When she starts to place her under arrest, Katya agrees to help set up a sting for Alex. When they rush the restaurant, Alex empties the gun he has of all but one bullet. He decides to play Russian Roulette while he tells them a Russian Love Poem which is the story of his crime. When he says he is lucky, he pulls the trigger again and shoots himself. Benson and Stabler take a few minutes to look out at the water before deciding to go home. As they walk toward the city, they try to make sense of the tragedy.

Hoping she can get a warm place to sleep, she opened the car door to find a dead man. She leaves the door open and walks away.When Munch and Cassidy arrive at the crime scene, Munch comments on the view. Cassidy tells him the view is nice at night as well. He begins telling him he had been there on a case, then it was a date, and finally saying it was with a guy friend of his. They are told a patrol car found the body. While checking the body, Cassidy finds a gunshot wound to the head and the groin. Upon searching the car, they find a holster but no weapon. When they ask if they had located any identification, Munch is handed a wallet identifying the man as Judge Warren Varella. He tells the other detective to be sure to seal the crime scene extra securely.Cassidy informs the team the ME places the time of death between 8 and 11 PM. Munch tells them he left work early to be alone. Benson informs them his wife last saw him as he headed to work that morning. Stabler tells them the wife is not talking. Jeffries suggest he was having an affair and his wife shot him in the groin and decided to remove his brains before telling them his cell phone battery was dead, but she is still checking to see if he may have tried to call for help. When Cragen asks if it could have been a hit, Munch reminds him he was shot in both heads. Stabler suggests maybe it was a disenchanted lover while Benson suggests a sex offender. Briscoe informs them the victim was licensed to carry and he had a permit for a 9mm. Cassidy informs them they found 9mm slugs. When Cragen suggests it was the victim's gun, he tells them they believe the gun is under the pier in several feet of water. Munch tells them they recovered one slug from the rocker panel and the other from the victim's jaw. After Benson tells them the family lawyers will not let them talk to his wife until the next day, Cragen tells them he is fielding calls from the press and the Criminal Justice Bureau, and DCPI wants him to issue a press release. He reminds them this was one of their own who was tough on sex offenders. Jeffries tells them he was responsible for the Together We're Safe house opening. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to check out the politics and Munch and Cassidy to check out all recent parolees. When Stabler leaves to head for the car, Benson assures Cassidy he knows nothing about them.In Judge Varella's chambers, Benson and Stabler are told there are 2000 sex offenders that would have wanted the judge dead. They are told a file was kept of all of the threats the judge received and they are welcome to it.Rodgers informs Benson and Stabler the shot to the groin came a minute or two before the one to the head. She also tells them she found he saliva on his glands along with Cherry Glow Lipstick. Stabler deduces he received oral sex prior to his death. Stabler decides the widow needs to start talking now.The widow tells them he always worked late and left early so she was not worried about him. When they ask if her husband was having an affair, she tells them she would be the last to know. Benson does not believe her. She believes she is standing by her man to protect his pension. Benson and Stabler meet with Emily Waterbury. She tells them the Women's Movement lost a champion in Judge Varella. She believes they should check the wife beaters and the sex offenders before checking to see if anyone in Albany could have killed him.While searching through files, Cassidy tells Munch paying for sex is pathetic. Munch responds by telling him not to publicize his office romance to everyone, invoking the ""Don't Ask. Don't Tell"" policy. Green, Melendez, and Yi are all recent parolees of Varella's. When comparing those names to the threats received, they find Melendez at the top of their suspect list. When Munch and Cassidy go to Melendez's apartment, Melendez freaks out and starts hitting his old lady. Cassidy pulls him off of her and arrests him while Munch stands between the two of them.When Benson and Stabler question Melendez, he denies knowing Judge Varella. He tells them he would not own a 9mm. He claims he was in parenting s Tuesday night. To test him, Stabler asks him what to do if his child breaks curfew. When he gives no answer,  Benson asks him why he was paroled. He tells her the Judge made him pay $2,226 to get out. Stabler informs him he failed the parenting midterm as he picks him up from his seat to return to jail.Cassidy informs Benson and Stabler the last call Varella made was to Emily Waterbury. After hearing this, Melendez's claim about bribery seems more likely. Stabler tells him she claimed not to know the judge. Cassidy says he and Munch will check out the bribe tip with other ex-cons. Benson and Stabler decide to speak with Waterbury again.Waterbury claims she cannot remember every phone call she gets everyday, but with Benson and Stabler's assistance she remembers she received a call from Varella the night he died. Stabler decides to call her on it. They also tell her they know about the charges against her for hooking. She claims the guys were boyfriends. Varella gave her clean start so she could help free truly rehabilitated prisoners so they can support their families again.At Varella's office, Benson and Stabler inform his assistant they need all appointment books, financial transactions, and records for all of the organizations the judge was involved in. She believes they are following the wrong lead.Cragen tells the team he knows judges that call their wives using calling cards to avoid even the thought of impropriety. He wants to know if the judge was cheating on his wife, taking bribes, or both. After some searching, Jefferies finds ""Together We're Safe"" has made $4.7 million in one year. When Cassidy is impressed by the amount of money this ""fledgling"" charity has made so quickly, Benson expresses that she is impressed by his use of ""fledgling"". He gets upset and causes a scene. Cragen tells all of them to follow the money before he calls Cassidy into his office. Once alone, Cragen gives him a tape of a statement he took from a 9-year-old when he was in Homicide. He informs him her mother's boyfriend molested her before killing her mother. He tells him he checks up on the girl from time to time. He wants him to go check on her for him.When Benson and Stabler speak with Waterbury again, they tell her they just want to solve the homicide case. She tells them Varella would convince the guys if they gave to a charity, then it would improve their image. She explains that when he called her to tell her yes or no on a parole vote, she would handle getting the bribes where they needed to go. She informs them the only thing Varella got out of it was the sex.When Benson and Stabler speak with Tyrell's wife, she confirms she was having sex with Varella to get him out of jail. Her last visit to Tyrell serves as her alibi.When Munch claims the charity is fake, Stabler tells him it was the donations that were fake. Benson informs the team three of the women stayed at the shelter. Cragen sends them back to the pier to see if they can find anything that may have been missed.While searching, Munch and Cassidy find the homeless woman. She tells them she heard the gunshots and saw a lady in a blue uniform got out of the car. When Munch gets mean with her, Cassidy makes him back off. They take her to the station to do a computer composite.Cassidy tells Benson and Stabler the homeless woman does not know what kind of uniform the woman was wearing. Stabler tells Cragen the last parolee Varella was working on was Roger Silver. Benson informs him two of the members of the parole board were on the take. He tells them to talk to the third.When meeting with the third member of the parole board, Benson and Stabler are informed she knew there was something going on, but she chose not to know the details. She tells them it is two against one vote. She explains the board meets once a month for one day and they each get paid $20,000 a year. While sitting in the hallway looking over the files, they notice Roger Silver's wife, Gina, is a flight attendant for Intercontinent Airlines. When Stabler looks at his watch, Benson sends him home in hopes his family has not changed the locks on him.The next morning, Stabler brings Benson a donut. She tells him Gina Silver and Varella have exchanged lengthy phone calls for two years. She informs him that Roger Silver was denied parole 3 times before and is up for parole again next week. Stabler cannot believe Gina would want Roger out of jail after he almost kills her. Benson reminds him it is not unusual.When Benson and Stabler ask Gina about her relationship with Varella and tell her they know about the four calls a week for 2 ½ years, she asks them if they can talk somewhere else. They tell her they have a car outside and wait while she tells her daughter she is leaving to talk with them. Before they leave, Stabler reassures her daughter that she will be back soon.When they get to the precinct, Munch and Cragen have the homeless woman look at a line-up containing Gina, but she is unable to pick her out. Gina's lawyer tells them without the eyewitness they do not have a slam dunk case. Benson tells him they can link her lipstick to the lipstick found on Varella. Stabler tells him once they get a DNA swab, they will have their slam dunk.In an interrogation room, Gina tells Benson and Stabler that Varella called her that morning and told her to meet him at the pier. She explains the calls were one-way phone sex and he confided in her who was on the take and in which department. She tells them the meeting at the pier was for her to pay her annual dues. When she finishes paying her dues, he tells her he has to end it. She tells him to make the call, but he told them ""wife's request denied"". She knew where he hid the gun so she got it and shot him. When Stabler asks for clarification as to why she wanted Roger out, she tells him she was doing this to keep him in.While meeting with the ADA, Cragen is showed pictures of Gina Silver's injuries. He tells him the charge was attempted murder. The ADA tells him since she killed a judge, it is a federal case and he cannot choose the charge. Cragen reminds him the judge was using and abusing women while he was supposed to be doing all of these things to help them. The ADA tells him to send his detectives to meet with Roger to prepare for Gina's trial.Roger sticks to his story about her hitting herself. Stabler tells him Varella is dead. When Benson asks if he knew about a relationship between Varella and Gina, he tells them he would call Gina to talk with his daughter before his parole hearings but she told him he would never see her again. Before he leaves, he tries to get them to deliver a threat to Gina.Cragen goes to the State Attorney General's office and gives them the files for Varella's activities. He explains Varella was not only exchanging oral sex for parole, but he was charging for the service.When Benson and Stabler meet in Cragen's office, he tells them the State Attorney General offered Gina a deal if she would flip on the others involved. After they both blow a gasket, he informs them that they can charge her later. He orders them to run the paperwork over to the courthouse before Gina is arraigned.When Benson and Stabler meet with Gina, they explain she will still be eligible for prosecution when the state is finished with her. They further explain if the information she obtains is no good, she will be arrested. When they tell her she lives in the area of the city dealing with a high crime rate and she will be getting minimal protection, she clarifies she will be on her own. Stabler tells her they do not like the deal she got, but they have to follow orders. After they explain what she needs to do, they take her home and begin the operation.   Cragen informs Benson and Stabler Roger Silver has Gina. When they leave Cassidy comes in and tells him he talked to the girl. After Cragen gives him a shot of alcohol, he informs him a guy the girl liked did her, then she was gang raped by seven or eight guys. The guys left her there alone and cold with nothing but a beach towel. She was so hurt she couldn't walk. When a guy comes by offering to help her comes along, she accepts his help only to be hurt again. When he breaks down, Cragen offers to let Cassidy a transfer to Narcotics.When Munch sees Cassidy packing up his locker, Cassidy tells him he is leaving. When he tells Munch of the offer to transfer, Munch tries to talk him into it. Cassidy gives him a small Nerf football before he walks out for the last time.When Benson and Stabler arrive at the scene, a uniform officer informs them Roger is holding Gina hostage. He also tells them a hostage negotiator is on the way, but he does not believe it can wait that long. Roger has Gina in the laundry room on the floor holding her down with one foot and a gun pointed at her. They both enter the room with their guns pointing to the floor. Stabler tries to talk him out of his gun. The closer Stabler gets, Benson trains her gun on Roger. When he aims at Stabler, Benson shoots him."

Captain Cragen was asked about a man masturbating on a bus. He informs the panel Benson and Stabler made an arrest the previous day. Benson and Stabler assures them they have the right man. The panel then brings up a string of rapes that occurred almost five years prior asking if anyone has looked at the cases under his command. When he tells them they have not, he is ordered to investigate the rapes. One of the victims, Victoria Kraft, tells her story and pleads for them to look into her case before the time runs out. Cragen informs her he will give her case top priority.As soon as they enter the squad room, Cragen tells Munch and Jeffries to check into Jennifer Neal and gives the other two victims to Benson and Stabler. He continues to explain the ME's office is trying to link DNA samples from unsolved rapes to those in the system or not. The three cases they are looking in to did not seem to be connected originally, but now they believe it is the same guy and the rapes occurred within one week. The ME has identified him as John Doe 121 using his DNA as the way to identify him. Benson and Stabler explains the MO (wears a stocking mask, breaks into apartments, climbs into bed with them, maces them, and rapes them) and description of the guy.Benson and Stabler speak with Lois Creen. They ask if she has remembered anything new, but she has not. Benson informs her of the other two attacks. When Stabler shows her a floor plan of the apartment she was living in, she remembers that in order to get to her bedroom you had to go through the bathroom and she assumes he left through the front door. Benson informs her they are working on the case full time and to call her anytime.Cragen informs ADA Eastman they need an arrest warrant based on the rapist's DNA. She does not believe they can pull it off since there is no case law in New York, but after much persuading she takes the file with her.Munch and Jefferies speak with Jennifer Neal. She tells them the rape was the worst thing that has happened to her, but the aftermath was the best thing. She tells them she went through a deep depression, but the people around her helped pull her out of it. Munch informs her they are reopening her case because they have the DNA. They inform her about the other two victims. She tells them the guy knew her dog's name and a restaurant she ate at frequently. She states she does not remember anything new. Jeffries informs her of the five year statute of limitations.Cragen and ADA Eastman ask the judge for the arrest warrant. He asks about any identification on the guy. They show him the DNA. He tells them to give him until the end of the day to decide.Benson and Stabler speak with Victoria Kraft. She tells them she did not believe the detectives were the best or the brightest so she hired a private investigator. A neighbor told the PI of a guy on a bicycle. Benson tells her they will speak with the neighbor.The neighbor says he saw a guy on a green R500 bike speed around the corner. He was wearing a motorcycle helmet and a jumpsuit.The judge explains the reason for the statute of limitations and denies the petition. He informs them he forwarded the case to the appeals division. Outside the courtroom, Benson and Stabler tell Kraft the decision will be appealed. She tells them they fell down on the job and waited five years to try some legal trickery to get their job done. She thanks them for making this the second worst day of her life.In the squad room, Cragen informs the detectives that the statute of limitations has expired on Victoria Kraft's case. When Cragen tells them he still wants them looking at her case since she can testify against him, Munch expresses his concern about throwing civil liberties to the wind in order to catch some guys. After Stabler tells Cragen they are going to speak with the original detectives who worked the cases, Cragen asks Munch if that is okay with him.Munch and Jeffries speaks with one of the detectives in Kraft's case. She tells them Kraft sued her because she said they were derelict in their duties, but the PBA lawyers handled it. The only thing she knew about the guy was he was the kind of person nobody notices. They tell her about the other two cases.Benson and Stabler speak with the detective for Jennifer Neal's case. He tells them he knew all about her. Stabler informs him of the other two cases. He tells them the other detective, Lattimer, said most rapes were fantasies.Benson and Stabler speak with Detective Dan Lattimer. They tell him they want to talk about an old case of his. He tells them the department squeezed him out just shy of being able to get his pension. When they ask him about Lois Creen's case, he says it was a one-night stand because the guy knew a lot of personal information about the victim. Stabler tells him of the other two victims. Lattimer blows it off offering them a drink.The appeals court judge asks why they do not file against every rape. He refuses to file the warrant so they can catch these guys at their leisure.Benson asks Creen to tell her story again. She tells them the guy knew about her fascination with Brandon Lee and he called her ""Lolly"" (her grandmother's nickname for her). She also tells them of the guy on the green bike.Benson and Stabler speak with the private investigator. He informs them he believed the guy on the bike to be a messenger with Green Machine Messenger Service. When they ask him if they tried to contact the company, he tells them it had already went out of business. He also tells them they have more resources to locate the employees than he does.Benson and Stabler inform Munch the guy has been watching the victims before the attacks. Jefferies informs them the owner of the messenger service now has a laundromat.When Munch and Jefferies ask the guy about the company, he informs them all of the employees wore the green jump suits. He also states they were better messengers than records keepers. He shows them a trunk full of records telling them they can have it all.Jeffries suggests they concentrate on the billing records. Benson immediately locates four deliveries to the business one of the victims worked at.Jennifer Neal tells Benson and Stabler she no longer wants to pursue the case. She lets it slip that she knows who it is. She tells them she has talked to the guy and she talked him out of turning himself in. She believes the guy has changed. She tells them she is a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Benson reminds her the Quakers created the penal system. She also reminds her of the other victims. Benson talks her into speaking with the other victims. Kraft tells her she wants a shot at him. Creen tells her she just wants a name. Kraft threatens to pull her business from Neal's company. Creen loses control of her emotions.Benson and Stabler fill Cragen in. He tells them he wants to try for a material witness order. Stabler reminds him they have never tried to force a victim to testify.In court, the judge tries to force Neal to give up the guy's name. When she continuously refuses, Neal is placed under arrest standing by her decision. Benson reminds Cragen they just sent a rape victim to lock-up when he asks if she is okay.Commissioner Morris discusses putting a rape victim in lock-up to Cragen. Cragen reminds him they are close to losing this case and the victim is their only chance of getting this guy. Morris tells him he is getting pressure from every angle. When Morris tells him he is close to insubordination, Cragen tells him to write him up or get out because he has work to do.Benson and Stabler speak with Neal's pastor. Stabler asks if he told Neal not to cooperate with them. He denies it. Benson tells him if he would give her a list of members, it might help them find the guy. He refuses telling them they need a warrant, but he will not be alone when they returned.Benson, Stabler, and Cragen return with back-up. Benson and Stabler do not like this idea. When they make their way inside, the building is full. The pastor tries to get them to leave, but they go ahead. Benson informs another member who reminds them that ""we all believe in the separation of church and state"" that she is just trying to find a rapist. She retrieves the list she needs and leaves.The team cross-references the list with the messenger employees. They try the original employment application and then look him up for priors. They find Harvey Denis was arrested previously for burglary and decide he must have been caught before he could commit the rape. They also find he was attacked in prison requiring hospitalization. When Benson and Stabler show up at the motel where Denis works. He buzzes them in and they find he is confined to a wheelchair. Stabler puts him into the car, and the wheelchair into the trunk. Denis keeps saying, ""You got me."""

One officer states the car radio would sell well on e-bay. When one officer gets to the window, he tells the other the radio was not stolen, but they shot him in the head and took his pants. When Benson and Stabler arrive at the scene, they are told one .44 round was found in the gearbox and plenty of fingerprints. While they are looking in the car, Stabler finds a small notebook with a time and location. Benson informs him the location is a gym where people would more likely go to play squash. A uniform officer takes them over to a family who heard the shots. The mother tells Benson she heard a pop because she had left the window open in her apartment because her radiator is broken. They are interrupted by a man wanting to give his statement because he was in a hurry. He tells Stabler he heard a boom, but he did not call the police because if he called about all of the noises he heard he would be on the phone half of his life.Cragen walks into the squad room with Benson and Stabler informing the team on their newest case as they enter. The victim was shot once in the back of the head. He is 35-year-old Dean Woodruff. He was a salesman of fitness equipment on lower Broadway. He is divorced with two kids who live upstate. His parents live in a small town near Saratoga. There were no eyewitnesses, but several heard a shot between 2 and 2:30. He was in his own car. His sales district was upstate and Jersey. Munch and Cragen agree that by using the .44 the shooter was an amateur, insecure, or a wacko citing a pro would use a .22 up close and personal so no one wakes up. Benson and Stabler inform them the spot is a grope spot for teenagers, honeymooners, and co-workers. After Munch suggests the victim may have been alone, Benson tells him his pants must have come off from the force of the shot. ME Rodgers informs Benson and Stabler she assumes the cause of death is from the gunshot wound to the back of the head since she is still picking through hair and glass fragments. When Benson questions the victim's purple legs, Rodgers tells her she believes it is just pooling. Rodgers tells Stabler not to get too excited about the fact she found semen because it could be a part of the body's natural death reflex.Munch and Jeffries check out Woodruff's office. They are told he came to work early, took short lunches, and left late. When he would make a deal, they would only deal with him from then on giving him the largest private client base. Munch asks for the list of Woodruff's clients. When Jeffries hears a woman, Moira Shannon, crying in the next room, she goes to speak with her. She tells her Woodruff was popular around the office. He would go with a group of them to Le Bar for drinks after work. Munch and Jeffries speak with a waitress at Le Bar. She asks if he skipped on some alimony or knocked the wrong girl up. When they inquire as to why she would think that, she tells them he had a never fail technique with the women. When they tell her he is dead, she tells them he left around 11:55 and he tipped 25%. Jeffries looks at the receipt noticing he used his expense account for 4 vodka gimlets, 2 cosmopolitans, and a roadkill. She tells them he could have left with anyone seeing as how the women that come in there are all the same.At Woodruff's apartment, Munch and Jeffries are told whenever Woodruff brought a woman home, she left with a key. After looking around a little, Jeffries finds 3 file folders – one with matchbooks, one with seashells, and one with cocktail napkins. They also find some cards. They are interrupted when Munch's cell phone rings and he has trouble answering it. Jeffries helps him by answering it herself. She tells him Shannon has two gun permits  – one for a 9mm and the other for a .44. She also tells him Shannon has no priors. Munch picks up a picture of Shannon and Woodruff and says she is not happy anymore.Munch and Jeffries return to speak with Shannon. She tells them she has not been to Le Bar in months. She informs them her father taught her to hunt leading to a fascination with guns. She tells them the .44 was a phase and she sold it to a gun shop in Dutchess County.Munch and Jeffries return to Le Bar to speak with the waitress again. She tells them Shannon was old news. As she looks through a stack of pictures, she tells them between each one she was with him. After a little hesitance, she tells them the lady he was with was the easiest score he had before pointing them to a table and tells them the lady they are looking for was with them part of the night. When they first approach the table, the guy gets a little upset at the intrusion. After Munch flashes his badge and Jeffries threatens to break his collarbone, his companion looks at the picture of Woodruff and tells them he was with one of the Mulroneys. In the squad room, Benson informs the team the Mulroneys make quite a large clan, but Stephanie is the only daughter left. Stabler tells them she was busted for possession and got a thousand hours of community service, Jeffries interrupts noting community service is what the Mulroneys do. Benson tells them she is 33 now and runs an investment group. When Munch tries to bring politics into it, Cragen cuts him off telling him she is a reluctant witness as of now. Stabler tells them they left a note at her apartment 3 hours prior and left several messages. The meeting is interrupted when Briscoe tells Cragen there is a lawyer, Patrick Rumsey, waiting in his office. Rumsey tells him he is acting as a family friend and wanted to give him a copy of Stephanie's statement while it was fresh on her mind. Cragen informs him they will be taking their own statement. Rumsey tells him as soon as she is ready.While Benson and Stabler wait for one of the Mulroneys, they look around at the decor. When Stabler keeps telling her things Munch told him about the Mulroneys, Benson reminds him that Munch says a lot and that is why they are there instead of Munch. Stabler notices something on the desk and asks what it is. Benson tells him it is a cigar cutter and notes it says ""Winston Churchill 1929"". They are joined by Mrs. Mulroney telling them Churchill lost it in a poker game. She further tells them every time a policeman has been in there home, someone has died. She tells them it has been 5 years to the day that her son died. When Benson tells her that her daughter was lucky, she is shocked by the remark until Benson clarifies that she survived the attack. She tries to tell them Stephanie has her own apartment, but Stabler tells her they have been there. Benson tells her kids go home when tragedy strikes. She tells them she is in seclusion in a private hospital. Benson promises if she will call her then they will leave her alone.When they arrive at the hospital, the doctor reminds them of the fact it is a private clinic and Stabler tells him he understands the hospital is endowed by the Mulroneys. The doctor explains Stephanie was admitted early the morning prior for trauma. He explains they treated the wounds and gave her Seconal to calm her. Mrs. Mulroney and Rumsey join Stephanie for her conversation with Benson and Stabler. Stabler promises to make it quick. She tells them she met Woodruff at Le Bar. They were both having a bad day. She left with him. In the car, he was leaning against the window and made a joke about the disadvantages of bucket seats. When Stabler asked her to explain the joke, Rumsey told him it was obvious. She leaned over to change the radio station, but she cannot remember the song that was playing. Then Woodruff was shot. She says the shooter had black-rimmed glasses with dark hair and a roundish face.In the team meeting in Cragen's office, Benson and Stabler inform them the information Stephanie gave them of a surprise attack is consistent with the autopsy – a single shot to the back of the head fired from outside the car. Stabler clarifies Stephanie is not surrounded by wagons, but tanks. Cragen verifies she got a good enough look at the shooter for a composite. Benson tells them Stephanie implied they did not have sex, but who knows considering she comes from a family of politicians. Jeffries suggests getting a DNA swab, but Cragen reminds them she was in the car with the victim. Benson hears the tension in his voice and asks if he is getting heat from the Brass. Cragen reminds them sympathy for the Mulroney family runs high. He tells Benson and Stabler to check out boyfriends of Woodruff's women and sends Jeffries and Munch to ballistics.In Ballistics, Munch and Jeffries are told Woodruff was killed by a Black Talon. Munch reminds them Black Talons were no longer being made because they killed too many cops were easily traced back to the manufacturers.Woodruff's ex-wife informs Benson and Stabler the last girl she knows of came to return a  Greek Philosophy book. She tells them she is not angry any more. She explains Dean's father worked in a lumber yard and Dean would work over the summer. Before long, he was running the office. He saw everything as a business transaction, but nothing was good enough for his father. She knows he had a lot of girls before the college went co-ed.At Barrett College, Benson and Stabler learn Stephanie reported that Woodruff raped her. The problem was her story never added up. They believe he seduced her then treated her shabbily resulting in the accusation.Cragen joins Benson and Stabler when they return to speak with Stephanie at her mother's home. He shows her a sketch and asks if it is accurate of the shooter. After glancing at the sketch, she tells them it is him. When Stabler tries to ask if she is sure nothing needs to be changed or added, Rumsey cuts him off. Stabler asks about Barrett College. He informs her they know she knew Woodruff from there. Benson adds she knew him intimately. Mrs. Mulroney steps in and tells Cragen they all want the same thing. He tells her he wants the truth.While in a meeting in DA Schiff's office, the agenda was to talk Cragen into getting on the Mulroney bandwagon. Cragen explains Stephanie's story is inconsistent. He tells them she had sex with the victim in Saratoga, but they are not sure if it was rape or a one-night stand. They believe she stewed in her anger and allowed herself to be picked up by him. He reminds them she was busted for possession of cocaine. Schiff tells him to find the weapon and he will have his case. Cragen reminds him they have motive and opportunity. When he is asked about the means, he reminds Schiff that 90% of the murderers he put in Attica are there without a murder weapon. Schiff tells him to talk to McCoy.In a meeting with Carmichael and McCoy, Cragen tells them cocaine users are prone to lying. He tells them she lied to them about when she met the victim and about her trauma so her mother could put her on ice. When Carmichael asks about Stephanie's reliability with the sketch, Cragen informs them they think Stephanie is the shooter citing she could not remember the song that was playing that caused her to change the radio station when she should have remembered it. When Carmichael questions Stephanie using a .44, McCoy reminds her she does not have to be the one to pull the trigger. He says he will have to run damage control with Schiff and security after the arraignment. Carmichael reminds him these people attract weirdos. McCoy cites her false statements and luring the guy to his death for revenge for charging her with Murder Two. He wants to flip her for the shooter.In court, Rumsey interrupts Judge Abrams request for a plea by asking for the restraints to be removed. Abrams agrees before Rumsey enters a not guilty plea for Stephanie. Mcoy asks for remand based on the fact her family obtained an expedited passport for her and the unlimited resources at her disposal making her a serious flight risk. Abrams states he finds it reprehensible she would lower the standards from which she was raised and he believes she would put herself above the law so he remands her to the Department of Corrections.On the courthouse steps, Rumsey tells reporters Abrams decision was wrong. He tells them she was not a flight risk, but the family had a family reunion planned in Bermuda. He believes Stephanie will be a part of that reunion when his decision is reviewed by his peers. McCoy tells the reporters the Mulroneys are used to getting their way. Carmichael tells themt hey deserve the due process of law – no more, no less.While Briscoe hands out coffee to the team, everyone is on their phones looking for a similar MO in any other cases. Jeffries breaks the reverie when she relays to Cragen there has been another shooting in a parked car, single shot with a .44 to the back of the head with the pants down.While the team is looking over the victim in the car, Benson asks for the round. The uniform officer shows it to her stating it was dug out of the visor on the passenger side. He tells them the car is registered to Stanley Brecker. When Benson asks if the woman is his wife, he tells them her name is not Brecker, it is Katish. When the team questions he, Katish tells them she did not think she would ever be involved in something like this. She implies he was shot while she was performing oral sex on the victim. She describes the shooter saying he wore Buddy Holly glasses like a little psychotic nerd. She tells Stabler she models, does temp work, and auditioned for Picnic. She tells them she met him in a bar.Benson and Stabler inform Pauline Brecker of her husband's death. They tell her they are not sure what the circumstances around his death. She tells them he was in the garment business. He was constantly worried about a union representative pressuring him or a goon asking for protection money. Jeffries informs Cragen that Ballistics is still trying to see if the bullets match. He tells her to follow the bullet. Munch suggests it could be a copycat. He tells him uniforms are in the park looking for the weapon, but have not found it yet. When Munch suggests their theory of ""Hell hath no fury"" is blown, Cragen asks if he has any new conspiracies to replace it with. When Benson informs them the wife is not even upset, Cragen asks why the killer kills the guys and leaves the girls. Stabler suggests he is a loser that never gets any himself. Meanwhile Briscoe works with Katish in coming up with a computer composite of the shooter. Jeffries enters Cragen's office informing him she went back 30 years checking the shootings using a .44. She states that out of 319, 12 were intermediate range, 3 from parked cars. She tells him two of them have arrests, but the guy tied in the Attica riot. She tells him of the open cases, there were 4 cases six years prior. One of them from the 27 and the other 3 were from the same gun. Cragen calls Lennie Briscoe asking him about a shooting with a .44 from '93-'94.Briscoe tells Benson and Stabler they never found a weapon, but they have a description of a guy with Buddy Holly glasses from a witness named Jill Templeton. After they tell them they arrested the wrong guy, Briscoe asks if he is back. Benson tells him he now has two more hits under his belt.Jeffries interrupts Cragen's wait for the other shoe to drop to tell him the bullet was from a .44 – same gun, same shooter. She also tells him she spoke with the owner of the gun shop in Jersey that sold the Black Talons to a guy with Buddy Holly glasses.Mr. Rhinehart tells Munch and Jeffries the guy would not have been noticed, but he kept dry firing the rifles. He finally told him to buy something or leave. The guy told him he wanted some cop killers before they went off the market. Since this is still s free country, he sold them to him. When they ask for the records, he tells them he is against government interference into free enterprise. Jeffries hands him a court order stating she is to and that is why she considers a court order an intrusion although sometimes it is a necessary one. He pulls the records and hands them to Jeffries. Jeffries reads 'Arthur Pruitt. December 4, 1994. 3 boxes Black Talons .44 caliber'.Stabler informs Jeffries he found five priors on Pruitt, including check kiting, forgery, and some Mickey Mouse stuff with phone sales. Benson tells the team the Feds say he was arrested with 100 credit cards at an Indian casino in California. She tells them he was released 5 months prior. He told his probation officer his mother was dying and gave an address in Chinatown. As the team gets ready to leave, Cragen tells them he is calling the 27 because it is their bust, too.When they arrive, the clerk point to Pruitt sitting on the sofa behind them. They approach him and ask if he is Pruitt. After he asks for identification, he puts on his glasses to see it and tells them he is the man they are looking for. When they search his room after arresting him, they find newspaper clippings hanging on a bulletin board of his crimes.When they put him in a line-up, all three witnesses walk in and identify him immediately. In the interrogation room, Green tells Pruitt when he saw the crime scene photos he almost blew his lunch. Briscoe tells him he and his partner were cold for weeks and could not get rid of the smell of death. Munch comes in yelling saying he is going to kill the guy himself as Jeffries weakly attempts to calm him. While he whispers ""I'm going to kill you"", in his ear, Pruitt asks Jeffries if this is legal to which she replies, ""Probably not"". Stabler tells him they have the Black Talons he bought, bu the explains it away as he is not the only one to buy them. When Stabler tells him they have 3 witnesses, he questions how they could have seen anything when the windows were fogged up because they were getting busy before explaining he has a vivid imagination. When Stabler tells him he is a gentleman of the old school, he tells them under coercion he confesses. Cragen tells Munch Pruitt confessed to killing Woodruff but Schiff is going to rip him a new one. Munch questions why the guy stonewalls them for an hour before confessing so what is his agenda.Rodgers explains to Munch the injuries to Brecker are the same as the other except he had other bruising from getting the crap beat out of him. At the same time, Munch tries to ask her out only to be shot down.Schiff tells Cragen they went on a wild goose chase on this case, but Cragen still believes he was right. When he cannot tell Schiff the case is still open, Schiff tells him he will have to fall on his sword, but it will be painless. The Mulroneys arrive and greet the men. Schiff informs them he asked the judge to dismiss the charges without prejudice in chambers to avoid further embarrassment. They express their gratitude. When Mrs. Mulroney informs Schiff she contacted Judge Abrams, Cragen took that as his cue and apologized before quickly leaving.Munch catches Cragen as he comes out of the building. He tells him the ME has doubts about Brecker. He explains the circumstances leading him to believe Brecker was a mob hit ordered by the Mulroneys. He believes Stephanie killed Woodruff. Cragen tells him he is not going to tell anyone they had this conversation. As Cragen walks away, Munch yells the Mulroneys will do anything to protect the family."

When Benson and Stabler arrive, they are told she had lived there for 50 years. The attacker ejaculated on her thigh and used her support hose to tie her up. Benson suggest the rape may have been an afterthought. Stabler wonders how someone could get those ideas about someone who looks like your grandmother.When Cragen sees Stabler talking to Skoda, he questions why, but does not get an answer. Cragen tells him to wait on the shrink, but Stabler tells him he already invited him. In the squad room, Benson and Stabler inform the team on the case. The victim is 72-year-old Lenora Bernstein. She got up, had tea and toast, and filled the bird feeder. The prep came through the window she forgot to lock, tied her up, and robbed and raped her. Stabler tells them her address book is the obits so he cannot find a next of kin to notify. When Stabler wonders what kind of guy would do something like this, Skoda tells them the prep is a sexually inexperienced teen to early twenties social misfit with a sporadic employment history. He guesses he may have been abused by his mother. After Cragen tells him to keep his assumptions about how the guy felt about his mother to himself, he tells Benson and Stabler to canvas and sends Munch and Jefferies to the ME. The ME tells Munch and Jeffries Lenora died from a heart attack brought on by the attack. When Munch clarifies she died of natural causes, Jeffries adds it was during the commission of a A felony making it Murder Two. The ME tells Munch he will be able to tell when the heart attack started after he dissects the arteries and will let them know as soon as he does.When Benson and Stabler speak with a friend of Mrs. Bernstein, they learn she had many expensive jewelry, but she sold them. The only jewelry she may have had some costume pieces left.Munch and Jeffries check for her costume jewelry. The clerk tells them he had someone try to get rid of pieces like they described, but he did not buy them so he did not get names. He describes them both as Dominican or Colombian teens. One is tall with dark hair and wears a fade. The other is short and has a tattoo of barbed wire crossing his fingers and one of a dagger with blood dripping. He agrees to work with a sketch artist.Benson and Stabler take the sketch to Mr. Bosic to see if he recognizes them. He offers to say whatever they want. They tell him they just want the truth. When they ask about his partner, he tells them Jimmy was in the truck out front. When they show the sketches to Jimmy, he says he recognizes them.Munch and Jeffries takes the sketch to the streets to see if anyone can help put a name to them. They approach a young lady and she tells them it looks like Carlos Medina and Alfonso. She tells them Carlos lives in the building beside the bodega and hassles everyone that walks by. Munch tells Jeffries the victim had to pass the bodega everyday. Jeffries adds that she would have to walk right past him.  When the team reaches the building, they witness a drug buy going down. After the sale is complete, they identify themselves and approach stopping the fleeing subjects. Munch and Jeffries apprehend the buyer and find prescription diuretics. Jeffries tells him he will not get high, but he will shed unsightly pounds. Benson and Stabler apprehend Carlos and Alfonso. When they bring the three together, the buyer starts talking in Spanish. Stabler asks him if he wants them to mirandize him in Spanish and English. When Munch hands Benson the prescription bottle, Benson reads ""Bernstein, Lenora"" on the bottle. Stabler tells them they want to go talk about her. Carlos tells Alfonso not to say a word.Benson and Stabler speak with Alfonso first. He tells them to talk to Carlos. They tell him they believe he did not believe her when she told him she sold all of her jewelry and he was angry. He tied her up and raped her. He tells them he did not rape her. They tell him they will talk to Carlos about it.When they walk in to talk to Carlos, he has his head down on the table like he is sleeping. Stabler pulls him up by the collar and looks at his hand. After he mentions the tattoos, Benson tells him the guy at the pawn shop raved about them. Carlos claims he found the jewelry next to the pills. Stabler informs him they found his prints in the victim's apartment. When he tells them he helped her with her groceries, Stabler asks if he brought them in through the window. Benson tells him good samaritans do not usually rape old women. When they tell him they have DNA evidence to prove it, he offers a sample.Benson and Stable return to Alfonso and tell him he must have raped her which led to her heart attack which killed her because Carlos offered a DNA sample. Alfonso agrees to the sample saying he did not do anything like that.As Benson and Stabler make their way back to the squad room, they are stopped by Cragen. They inform him both suspects volunteered a DNA sample, but they sent them in anyway. When Cragen asks if one is playing them, Stabler tells him there could be a third guy.The ADA joins Cragen, Benson, and Stabler in Cragen's office asking why she was not told about another guy. They explain they thought there were only two guys at first, but the DNA places a third guy there. They assure her they have the two on robbery though. They ask what they can offer them for the third guy. She tells them they currently have them on Robbery One, two counts of Robbery Two, and many lesser charges. She will give them Robbery Two and Criminal Trespass giving them 5 instead of 15 if they get a name.Munch and Jefferies bring the offer to the teens. Carlos refuses saying they want the rapist and he wants a free pass. He tells Alfonso they do not want them so let him handle it. They tell them if they find the rapist on their own, then both teens will do the max. Jefferies tells the teens to enjoy the cavity search as they leave.Benson and Stabler check with an administrator at Stephen Foster High School to make sure Carlos and Alfonso ditched school on the 14th. When they are informed the two were suspended for breaking into school lockers, they ask about any other boys they hang out with or have been in trouble with. She tells them the teen she knows of does not hang out with them anymore and has turned his life around. She tells them Emmanuel Clemente was absent on the 14th.Jeffries and Munch meet up with Emmanuel. He tells them he does not hang around with Carlos and Alfonso any more and he has nothing to feel guilty about. He tells them Mrs. Bernstein used to give them quarters. When Munch and Jefferies explain that is an insult, he tells them they told her to keep her quarters. He informs them he missed school on the 14th to take his little sister to the methadone clinic.Munch and Jefferies return to the squad room empty handed. They tell Benson and Stabler that Emmanuel was seen arriving with a 14-year-old around 9:00 and stayed at least two hours. The receptionist discussed baseball stats with him. When Cragen comes in, they inform him they are back to square one. He asks if the ADA might let one of them walk and the other take the max. Skoda tells them since Carlos has been through the system he will not think twice about rolling on Alfonso. He tells them Alfonso is a follower and that will make him harder to turn, but if he is scared he may do it. Cragen tells them to use the fear to motivate Alfonso.Benson and Stabler bring the new deal to Alfonso. They tell him he will get dropped to third-degree robbery and sentenced as a youthful offender which could mean 18 months in jail or probation if he cooperates. When they tell him only one of them gets the deal, he asks if he can think about it. They give him twelve hours to think about it reminding him Carlos would take it in a heartbeat.When they return to the precinct, Benson and Stabler tell Munch and Jeffries that Alfonso wants to think about it even though he wants it. They are interrupted when Cragen informs them the DA called with a taker on the deal and they waiting for them.Benson and Stabler are surprised to see Carlos when they arrive at the DA's office. He tells them Alfonso asked for his advice and he had to counsel him against the deal. His lawyer tells them he is amenable to the terms. Carlos tells them he and Alfonso went in the window. They trashed the place when they could not find anything. When they heard a cuckoo clock sound once, Alfonso took off and he chased him down. Benson tells Stabler that it was 9:30. Stabler asked if they left the other guy there. He tells them he did not leave anyone behind. Benson reminds him if he lies, the deal is gone. He drags Alfonso back, but a white guy was there with a beige uniform was there. Alfonso tells him they need to go since they trashed the place so they leave. Benson and Stabler clarify the delivery guy raped her.In the squad room, Benson and Stabler relay the information from Carlos. Munch suspects they decided to turn the hero into a patsy. Skoda tells them the profile would make more sense if it were Carlos, but it could also be someone trying to make themselves into a hero. Cragen warns them to tread lightly because this guy made the papers and he does not want another Richard Jewell on their hands. Benson and Stabler return to the squad room with the knowledge Alfonso now wants the deal. Jeffries informs them Stan Bosic has a record. He served time in Sing-Sing for armed robbery. She notes he was not busted for any sexual assaults. Benson tells them if he got away with it, he had to tell someone and cell mates are a captive audience. Jeffries tells them he bunked with Jonathan Smith, who is now out of jail.Benson and Stabler catch up with Johnny Schmidt on his garbage route. He tells them Bosic would not shut up. He bragged about working in the pharmaceutical transportation industry and he was sleeping with women on his route. He believed no woman could resist him.Munch and Jeffries catch up with Jimmy Walp on his way to work. He tells them Bosic calls the deliveries where he is sleeping with the woman special deliveries. When they ask if he ever made a special delivery to Mrs. Bernstein, he tells them no and goes to get a newspaper. Munch and Jeffries believe he knows more than he is telling. They decide to talk to Bosic next.Benson and Stabler escort Bosic from work to the station for questioning. He denies ever sleeping with anyone on his route ever. When Benson tells him they heard different, he tells them he brags. He tells them he lied on his job application because he knew they would not hire an ex-con. When Stabler asks how they would feel when they find out he raped Mrs. Bernstein, he tells them he never touched her leading him to admit he never gave her CPR. He explains Jimmy takes the tanks up in buildings without elevators, even though he was not supposed to. When he took too long, Bosic went up to the apartment. He saw the new tank by the door, her tied to the bed, and Jimmy in the bathroom freaking out. He created a win-win situation by allowing him to keep his job, got his name in the papers, and Jimmy did not have to deal with it. Benson tells him they will just put both of them in a line-up and see who saw what.Bosic is in the first line-up. Carlos immediately says he is not there. Jimmy is in the second line-up and Carlos picks him out. When his lawyer says her client fulfilled his side of the deal, they remind her it is only if it leads to an arrest. They tell her they will send the paperwork over when it is ready.In the squad room, Munch informs Benson and Stabler of the autopsy findings. Mrs. Bernstein had two separate heart attacks. The first one occurred within one hour of the one that killed her. The ME states if she had not had the first one, then the second one would not have killed her. They tell him they just let Carlos go. Munch suggests they not lose anyone else.Jimmy tells Benson and Stabler he always took the tanks up because of Bosic's bad back. He tells them her door was ajar when he arrived so he went in, saw it was a mess, and called for her. He states he found her on the bed wearing her nightie and happy to see him. He denies tying her up and raping her. Skoda arrives at Cragen's office to a meeting with him, Benson, Stabler, and the ADA. They tell him the defense said he wrote a psych evaluation on Walp and they are calling for a hearing. They tell him that if they find Walp did not understand his miranda rights, then they lose his statement and everything that came after it. He denies writing a psych evaluation on Walp. He tells them he wrote a sticky note and put it on his desk by the DD5. When Stabler asks what was on it, he tells them ""Retarded and a question mark."" He adds it never should have left the office. The ADA tells him it made it into the discovery packet. They are told to dig until they can find something to prove he did understand. Jefferies arrives in the squad room holding Walp's Board of Education records. When Benson tells her an IQ score of  70 or below fies him as mentally retarded, she informs them he was never tested. When they are told his grades were D's and F's, Munch tells them Einstein consistently flunked math. Benson sarcastically tells him they will argue he is another Einstein. Munch informs them Walp had difficulty sustaining employment citing he was even fired from McDonalds. Stabler reminds them he did get jobs and he did live on his own without help.Benson and Stabler get his manager to let them into his apartment with a warrant. Books are everywhere. He always paid with cash and kept the receipts. He possessed a lot of porn. When Stabler opened the stove, he found more books. The manager told him he always ate at Lilly's Diner.At Lilly's Diner, the waitress tells them he always sits at the counter and talks to whoever is next to him. He studies the menu carefully, but always orders the special.His mother tells Benson and Stabler she had seven kids. She could set him front of the television and he would be entertained for hours. She denies he was slow. She tells them she has not seen him since he was 18.Munch arrives in the squad room and informs the team the defense administered an IQ tests and he received the results. Walp's IQ is 68. Stabler reminds them it would not have been in his best interest to actually try. Stabler hands Munch a porn video case from Walp's apartment. He reads the title and hands it to Benson. When she tries to return it, Stabler tells her to flip it over. The picture on the back shows a woman in the same position Mrs. Bernstein was found. Benson reminds him Carlos and Alfonso were the ones to tie her up and Jimmy found her that way. When Skoda and Cragen arrive, Benson shows them the case. Skoda tells them when Walp saw her he probably thought he was expected to perform a sex act since the mentally retarded mimic to appear normal. Cragen tells him Walp understands enough to know he did something wrong and he does not want to lose his statement. Skoda agrees Walp needs to be locked up, but where. Stabler reminds him there are 250 mentally retarded currently sitting on death row.In court, Stabler states they found no evidence supporting Walp's mental retardation and no reason to ask Walp to read anything out loud. The defense attorney informs him the mentally retarded will act like they are reading books in public places and will wear a watch when they cannot tell time to appear normal. When Walp is asked to explain his rights, he simply repeats them. When the ADA asks if he thinks he is mentally retarded, he tells her he can prove he is not mentally retarded by telling them what he did to Mrs. Bernstein. The judge tells them he wants to hear what Walp has to say so whatever he says will be off the record. He explains he has never done t before but he has seen it on the videos. While he was on top of her, he noticed something was wrong so he tried to perform CPR, but he must have been doing it wrong. He did not know how to explain what happened to anyone so he went to the bathroom and that is where Bosic found him.Skoda catches up to Cragen at the station and tells him they need to get together on their sentencing recommendation. Cragen tells him to write the report and sign his name to it. He is upset that Walp missed the mark by 2 points. When Skoda says he saw devastation for what he did, Cragen disagrees saying he saw remorse. Cragen reminds him that while Walp is going to be able to sit in a quiet place an read Winnie the Pooh, Mrs. Bernstein gets a headstone.Skoda escorts Walp into the psychiatric hospital. As Skoda tries to explain he will help with his intake, Walp asks if he will stay with him. Skoda tells him he will stay for a while as they walk in. When Walp sees the other patients, he begins repeating ""No"" and shaking his head."

When Benson and Stabler arrive, a CSU tech comments on the number of fingerprints in hotel rooms. Stabler notes the condition of the room. The tech informs them the victim did not have any valuables anywhere in the hotel. Benson notes the victim's purse does not contain money or jewelry. After noticing marks on the victim's neck, Stabler guesses she died of asphyxiation. The ME puts time of death from 4 to 10 in the evening. Since the arms are crossed, they guess it was personal.Benson and Stabler arrive in the middle of a discussion on rape between Munch and Jeffries. Cragen interrupts their banter for the team meeting. Benson and Stabler inform them the initial cause of death is presumed to be strangulation early in the evening. Their guess is it was a Robbery-Rape-Homicide. There was no sign of forced entry. If she fought back, she did not fight for too long. When they cannot rule out a type of suspect, Stabler informs them they are doing exclusionary prints and DNA of all the hotel staff before Cragen asks about the victim. The victim is Sylvia Hadley. She is married, but her husband is in Baltimore. She is in New York with her father-in-law, Dr. Benjamin Hadley, and his wife to attend the National Conference of Christian Colleges. Dr. Hadley is the president of Midvale College. Her husband has been notified and is on his way. When Stabler informs Cragen they need to speak with the in-laws again, he tells them to be direct, but discreet because he can smell the politics.ME Rodgers informs Munch and Jeffries she has confirmed the cause of death as manual strangulation and narrowed the time of death to between 6:30 and 9. The rape kit was positive for semen as well as the sheets and it is a good sample.Benson and Stabler are told by the Hadleys that Sylvia decided to skip the mixer stating she was tired from walking around the city. They inform them Brad Weber, their financial guy, and Sylvia have been working late on the annual report. They deny she has any enemies.The head of security tells them they have separate cameras watching the guests and the staff. They also have electronic locks that register whenever a door is opened. He gives them the logs to her room as well as any other activity. He warns them the video is not time stamped, but they can have it. He informs them the Baxter Arms was burglarized. As they leave, Benson reads the printout and relays the information to Stabler. The maid cleans her room at 9:25 and she did not have any room service during the crucial time on Sunday. After Stabler notes she got to her room at 5, he suggests the perp was waiting on her and left when he would not be seen.Benson and Stabler meet with Brad Weber at his office. He confirms he and Sylvia met Sunday night to go over the report stating they had a meeting scheduled for later today. He worked late at the office, went window shopping on Fifth Avenue, and returned to the hotel around 9 and crashed. The only ones that may be able to confirm his story would be the front desk if they were awake.When Munch asks Sylvia's husband, Ben, if they were having any problems, he tells them she was not having an affair. When Jefferies asks if they were having financial trouble, he asks if they have to put their private lives under a microscope claiming it was a New York psycho that killed her. After Jefferies assures him they are doing everything they can, Munch introduces Benson and Stabler as they walk in as the detectives on the case. Once they tell him they are working on some leads, he excuses himself stating he needs to see his parents. While Stabler places a call, Benson informs them Brad Weber left the office around 6 and did not return to the hotel until around 9. Munch informs her the only staff in the room so far were a maid and a room service guy with an alibi. When Benson tells them about a burglar hitting pricey hotels, Stabler informs them there is a task force on it. Benson hands the security videos to Briscoe to view and warns him they are not time stamped. Stabler tells them the latest burglary victim is Lana Hoffman, a guest at the Sussex.Lana informs Benson and Stabler that not only was her safe cleaned out, but the burglar masturbated in her underwear. The other detectives dismissed it. She tells them of a thin, creepy guy always sitting in the lounge wearing a red baseball cap and wire-rimmed glasses. She adds he rode the elevator up once. Benson and Stabler tell the burglary detective they could have helped him on this case by telling him he is wasting his time looking for the property, the perp stalks his victims for a few days first, he likes blondes, and he gets half of his rush from being in plain view in the hotel. The detective tells them no one wants to call them because of the perversion they deal with and they are afraid they will catch it. Benson receives a call from Cragen informing them the victim was pregnant making it a double homicide.In the squad room, Jeffries informs them Briscoe is sorting the videos using the hotel's schedule so it will take time. The team works through what they know about the burglaries. They started four months prior with the Baxter Arms from a little over a week ago being the most recent. Each hotel is hit once or twice. There are no signs of forced entry, the occupants are never there, and the perp did not use a staff card. Only hotels with electronic key card access to the rooms are hit. Munch wonders if he is using something to crack the lock codes speculating he may be former FBI or CIA. Cragen interrupts them to play part of a press conference Dr. Hadley is holding. When Cragen asks where they are, Stabler tells him they have the description of a burglar with a similar MO.The team goes to Ralliston Hotel. While Munch and Jeffries share an elevator with their suspect, Benson and Stabler wait patiently for the room number. When John Fenwick gains access to the room, Jeffries calls the others to join them. When they arrive, Munch slides the electronic key card giving the team access. They are able to arrest Fenwick without incident. As they escort him to the car, the burglary detective tells them it is their collar since their investigation has been going on longer. Benson and Stabler inform him their captain spoke with the mayor and he did not like their unwillingness to cooperate. When the detective grabs Stabler, Stabler fights back. As they put Fenwick in the car, he tells Munch and Jeffries if Stabler is the one to question him then he wants his lawyer present.Fenwick tells Munch and Jeffries he created the device he used to gain access to the room with his knowledge of electronics and computers. The items stolen are in his apartment neatly cataloged so they can be returned. He was doing it to prove the point of it being too easy to get by electronic locks. When his lawyer tells him to shut up, he reminds him that his job is to get him the best deal. Munch and Jeffries give them time to talk when they hear a knock on the one-way. They tell Benson and Stabler their next round will be bad cop. Benson and Stabler asks their opinion on whether to tell Sylvia's family about her pregnancy. Munch and Jeffries agree they should withhold the information before heading back in. They ask Fenwick about his alibi for Sunday night. He tells them he stole a diamond-studded collar from a terrier at Soho East. Benson and Stabler tell the Hadleys they do not have the guy. Stabler tells them it does not help them to get the press riled up. Ben wonders what is so hard about it when his wife died in a hotel.Jeffries verified the theft of the dog collar and is working on a search warrant for Fenwick's apartment. Benson suggests Sylvia had not told her husband about the baby because she was having an affair. Jeffries thinks she may have just wanted to be sure first. Benson wonders if someone else could have been stalking Sylvia the same night. Cragen thinks she knew the guy. Munch thinks she may not have been family oriented. Cragen tells Munch and Jeffries to stick with Fenwick and Benson and Stabler to check out Sylvia at the hotel.At the Versailles Hotel, Benson and Stabler speak with Room Service. They are told Sylvia would order something and then when it was delivered she would think of something else she wanted. The night before she was killed, they told her they could not restock her mini bar so she went to the bar. They never saw another person in the room, but there could have been. In the bar, the bartender tells them Sylvia was there on Friday and Saturday night. On Saturday night she was with Brad Weber. She was trying to lose control while he was trying to keep it. The two left together.Benson and Stabler call Weber in for questioning. He claims the account is high maintenance and they are his biggest clients. When he denies having an affair with Sylvia, Benson tells him the bartender saw more than an investment meeting. She hit on him and he felt she could ruin his life. Stabler informs him that is called a motive for murder. Even though he drank the beers slowly they still went to his head. He found himself walking her back to her room. They kissed outside her room. He realized he just changed his relationship with his wife forever so he went back to his room. He sticks with the fact he was in his room Sunday night. When he tells them he did not watch any paid movies, they tell him that does not look good for his story.Dr. Hadley tells Benson and Stabler he has known Weber for a long time and he is good with the endowment's money. He informs them Weber was usually drunk at their functions and hitting on the women. With Ben standing behind him, he implies Weber was sleeping with Sylvia stating Ben just did not want to see it. Benson and Stabler meet with Weber and his attorney in an interrogation room. He admits to drinking often at Midvale functions because of the stress involved. He explains the extra time with Sylvia saying Dr. Hadley made a bad deal when he bought the college and now there is a balloon payment due on it that requires a lot of planning. He agrees to a blood test to get him off their suspect list. Jeffries informs the team Midvale was censured by the American Academy of Academic Professors because Dr. Hadley fires anyone who disagrees with him. Benson verifies Dr. Hadley's degree stating he earned it from Lutheran Ministry College in Jackson, Mississippi. Stabler thinks they can get more information from Ben so Cragen sends him and Benson to the memorial service. Cragen sends Munch and Jeffries to track down one of the fired professors.The fired professor tells Munch and Jeffries he is a professor of Philosophy and began teaching at Midvale in '89 because of its c curriculum. He realized the curriculum meant nothing to Dr. Hadley other than the wealthy donors it attracted. Sylvia spent more time working with Dr. Hadley than living with Ben. While Ben got his job from his father, Sylvia was headstrong. Benson and Stabler arrive at the memorial service in time to hear Dr. Hadley announce the establishment of the Sylvia Stone Hadley Memorial Fund. When the service is over, they inform Ben that Weber offered his DNA. When they ask if there is anyone else she had frequent contact with they should be looking at, he admits over the past several years she had changed so much he did not know her or her life.Jeffries informs Cragen the DNA excludes the former employees. Cragen informs them Weber's DNA cleared him and he resigned as manger of the endowment. Dr. Hadley was being honored by his peers. Ben was grading papers in Baltimore. Sharon, Ben's mother, seems to be the glue that holds the family together. Cragen wants the family's DNA. He tells them to ask nicely, but get a warrant if they need to. He also wants Sharon questioned alone.Sharon tells Benson happiness is highly overrated. When Benson informs her Sylvia was two months pregnant, Sharon tells her Dr. Hadley had been having an affair with Sylvia for the past two years.Cragen tells the team if Sharon tries to leave, then arrest her for obstruction because he does not want her to give the men in her life the heads up that they are coming for them. He orders Ben and Dr. Hadley brought in separately. Dr. Hadley lawyers up. Benson and Stabler are called out so Briscoe can tell him what he found on the tapes. He shows them a picture of Ben on the hotel elevator around the time Sylvia was killed. They verify Ben's arrival through his credit card, ATM withdrawals, and pictures from the hotel elevator. When Benson shows the ADA the DNA test results, he decides he wants them both. Cragen tells them to put the two together and flip them both.Cragen tells Ben they caught him in a lie. After his father and his lawyer tries to defend him, Cragen asks if he ever speaks for himself. When he sticks to his story about being in Baltimore, Cragen brings Jefferies in with the DNA results. The skin under Sylvia's fingernails belongs to Ben, but the semen belongs to Dr. Hadley. Cragen asks if Ben wants to make a statement. Ben had been suspicious for some time. When this trip came up, he followed. When it took her ten minutes to answer the door, she said she was sleeping and he wanted to know who with. He started trying to shake some sense into her. When she went limp, he choked her. As Ben and his lawyer leave, Ben tells his father he cannot believe he went to him to fix this. Sharon joins them. Cragen tells Dr. Hadley Sharon knows more than he thinks. Dr. Hadley denies it. She questions if he is trying to protect her. She asks if he made up the robbery story to cover up what Ben did or to make sure he did not find out she was pregnant. She asks him if he was going to call the child ""son"" or ""Ben the third."" When he claims it is the grief talking, she explains it is her talking after watching him have an affair for two years and father his own grandchild. She implies she is filing for divorce before she leaves."

At the hospital, she tells Benson and Stabler ""the yachtsman"" took her to a vacant lot, pulled a gun on her, raped her, and told her if she tells anyone he will kill her.She explains she met him in a chat room and felt he was harmless with that name. He said he would pick her up at the coffee house at 7 in a beige Mercury Sable.At the station, Benson hands out copies of a sketch of 16-year-old Karen's attacker. When Munch suggests they work with the Coast Guard because of his name, Cragen informs him they met in a chat room. Benson tells them they need to speak with Karen again. Cragen tells them that by the time the lab tells them anything the guy could be half way around the world. Jeffries volunteers to check the victim's computer. Cragen informs her Karen lives with her mother in Brooklyn and sends Munch with her to pick the computer up. Munch muses there are 70 million suspects on the internet.Benson and Stabler speak with Karen in an interview room. Stabler verifies the prep picked her up at 7 and she checked in at the hospital a little after 11. She tells them they talked about school and drove around to different places. She states they have been corresponding for three or four months and she decided to meet him at the time because her mother had choir practice. Stabler suggests they drive through the events to help them find the guy.Melissa Raye, Karen's mother, tells Munch and Jeffries she dropped Karen off at the library at 6:15, but when she went to check on her at 8:30 she was not there. Karen is not allowed to date. She is allowed to attend church and school functions as long as there is a chaperone. She is allowed to have boys over as long as they are friends. She informs them she never married Karen's father, but he has court-ordered visitation. The computer Karen uses is at her father's apartment.Benson and Stabler are attempting to drive through Karen's night. She shows them the corner he picked her up at and the direction he was driving in. She tells Stabler to make a quick left, but he turns right informing her it is a one-way street. She figures she was just wrong about the direction. Munch and Jeffries speak with David Marolo, Karen's father. He tells them Karen is a good student. When he informs them she downloaded a lot of music, he adds she knows more about computers than he does. They request to take the computer causing him to warn them there are pictures of nudes posing with animals on it that are password protected.Benson, Stabler, and Karen arrive at a lot where Karen claims she was raped. There are a lot of people around so they question her statement of no one seeing or hearing them. She realizes they do not believe her and tell them it is worse than the rape. Benson tells her they need to get the details right so if she is missing something she needs to tell them.When Benson, Stabler, and Karen return to the squad room, Karen questions how they obtained her father's computer. After Munch informs her that her father wants to catch the guy, Stabler has Debbie take Karen into the interview room and get her a soda. Once she is out of the room, Benson sees a picture of Miss September posing with an ocelot. Stabler informs them he doubts the existence of ""the yachtsman."" Munch tells them the guy sent her e-mails and encrypted pictures. He hands over the e-mails as Jeffries tells them a tech guy is coming to try to help them view the pictures.When Benson and Stabler confront Karen with the e-mails, she admits she never met ""the yachtsman."" She was with her boyfriend and they made love. She did not want her mother to find out because she would have made her undress in front of her and smell her hair. Stabler informs her filing a false police report is a crime and took their time away from helping real rape victims. After Benson hands her a pen and pad to recant the original story and to tell the truth, Karen asks if they are going to arrest her boyfriend. When she tells them he is 21, Stabler tells Benson they need to talk to him.Stabler speaks with Keith, Karen's boyfriend, in an interview room. Once Stabler verifies Keith knew both of their ages, Keith explains Karen is more mature than the girls he has met in college. Stabler assures him she is not that mature before he asks if he knows what Statutory Rape is. Stabler tells him to give it a rest for a year or year and a half and if after that he still wants to see her then he will not have any problems with him.As Stabler returns to the squad room, he announces the only difference between them and Robbery is robbery victims do not lie. Cragen informs him the case was not a total waste of time. He is told the pictures ""the yachtsman"" e-mailed her was of his blacked-out face and young girls. When Stabler says he does not need to look at it, Cragen reminds him it is evidence.When Stabler tells Kathy about the pictures, Kathy tells him she gets e-mails like that every day. Stabler clarifies with these sites you never know the people's real ages. They realize their children are probably getting these e-mails as well. Stabler tells Kathy he cannot restrain someone he cannot see or hear. He reminds her these predators are in their own home through their computer.Benson and Stabler are told the ISP respects their clients' privacy. When they inform him one of his clients posted sex pictures of himself with minors and they are sure he wants his other clients to know he is helping to stop the problem, he types the screen name into the computer. He explains that every time you click your mouse you are sending out personal information. Benson compares it to a constantly running tape recorder. They are told ""the yachtsman"" is actually Harry Waters. He likes to visit sex chat rooms, porn sites, programming sites, music sites that appeal to teen girls, poker, and auction sites. He won seven panty auctions on e-bay. He works at universal.net.At universal.net, they are told Waters was a great programmer, but he was not liked. After the company received their ISP, they went to Cuba. While every one else went to the Orioles game, Waters stayed behind saying he was sick so they bought him some souvenirs. When they tried to deliver them, a young girl came out and asked if they wanted a good time too. When they returned, Waters quit and no one wanted to touch his computer. He gladly gave them the computer.Jeffries informs Benson and Stabler the only thing they got off the computer were file names of files stored on Keith's computer. They pick Keith up and bring him back to the station. Stabler cuffs him to the interrogation room table. Keith tells them he was just storing it and he does not know what it is in the files. Stabler tells him he is either getting something out of it or he is storing it for his best friend. Stabler reminds him the girls are underage, drugged, and being photographed without their permission after Keith claims they are just pictures. Keith admits they are his pictures. It started out as revenge on an ex-girlfriend of a friend. When they posted them, they received e-mails from guys willing to pay. At first it was girls they knew, then they began taking requests. Stabler explains he is a pimp. Keith tells them he was paid in cyberbucks so it would be untraceable and keep the cops away.When Maureen comes down and tells Stabler she is going to Hannah's to study for a history test, Stabler reminds her the test is on Tuesday so Hannah can come over to study. She tells him Hannah's house is quieter because she is an only child causing him to ask if she is going to her mother's or her father's. Maureen realizes he should not know this information so she asks if he has been reading her e-mail. He explains he wanted to see if someone has been sending her something they should not. She tells him she receives ten junk e-mails a day and she deletes them all. When she asks if he wants to read her journal, he causes her to storm off after trying to verify she has journal.While Munch cleans the spilled coffee from his desk, he informs them Pam Anderson and sex are the top two search terms on the net. Stabler clarifies Pam Anderson is over eighteen, but the girls in the pictures are not. Munch reminds them they could be faked. Cragen tells him he would rather hear the excuses from the perp. When Cragen tells them to trace his e-mail, Jeffries tells him the guy reroutes his sessions so they cannot trace it. Cragen tells them to track him down on one of the sites they know he visits and give him what he wants.While Munch is in a chat room posing as 12-year-old ""Nicole,"" ""the yachtsman"" explains to ""Amy"" how to get Prozac from her parents. Cragen tells Munch to talk to him. Munch tells him he may need some Prozac as well because his parents are harsh. Munch relays ""the yachtsman"" wants to meet the next day at a café in Chelsea at noon.When ""the yachtsman"" approaches a girl and introduces himself, Munch interrupts saying he is ""Nicole."" Stabler helps Munch escort Waters out of the café as Waters tells them they need to talk to his lawyer.As Cragen and ADA Eastman walk into the room where Waters is sitting with his lawyer Hammonds, Hammonds asks them what the charges are. Eastman tells her he is charged with soliciting a minor. Hammonds reminds them he solicited a detective pretending to be a minor. Cragen asks to speak with her off the record. Cragen explains the incident in Cuba and corrects her when she claims he was fired from that job. Hammonds tells Cragen she understands his warning, but she will not neglect her duties to her client. Once she is gone, Eastman warns him she is going to claim Waters knew he was talking to an adult the entire time. When he tries to tell her he has solicited real minors, she explains cyber-crimes are tough to prosecute.When Cragen explains Eastman needs a real live victim, they tell him the only contact he made was the panty auctions. Benson guesses he may have been more interested in the return address. Jeffries tells them he bought three pair from a 15-year-old in Queens.When Munch and Jeffries arrive at Doris Harrington's residence, they find a group of elderly ladies sitting at the table gambling. Jefferies locates a pile of brown packages and opens one pulling out a pair of panties. Doris explains they advertise ""used homecoming queen undergarments.""At St. Monica's High School, Benson and Stabler are informed the faculty and staff are checked by an outside firm. They had security features on the internet, but the program prevented the students from researching important topics so they blocked the program. When they are introduced to Elaine, Benson asks if she knows Harry Waters and Stabler adds his screen name. She tells them she and Waters had a thing. They decide to finish their discussion at the station.Elaine tells them she met Waters when he came to her house one day wanting to order more panties. He asked her about school, the music she likes, and what she likes to do for fun. She told him she was fourteen. He told her his daughter died in a wreck. They became intimate in September. They met at the park by the fountain on a Saturday. She explains her father left when she was eight. She continues saying Waters took her to a restaurant by the lake and treated her like a princess. When she tells them his smell reminded her of her father, Stabler excuses himself.Stabler asks Cragen if they have anything on this guy. When Cragen tells him there was no real sex, Stabler reminds him the guy perved her in ways she is not even aware of. Cragen tells him to pretend she told them they had and bring him in on having an improper relationship with a minor. Stabler promises to have him there in the morning.When Waters and Hammonds arrive, Stabler tells them the 14-year-old's story is different. They watch as Jefferies escorts Elaine out of the squad room before Stabler continues saying it is different when the victim is in the flesh. Waters decides he wants to talk. Eastman lists off the crimes Waters can be charged with. When she mentions a federal charge, Hammonds tells her if it goes federal she wants a trial. Stabler offers to take the charge off the table if he gives up his other contacts with minors. Hammonds agrees to the case involving Elaine only, he becomes a registered sex offender, and joins a program. Stabler says he must do some time. She tells them Waters can give them the names of nine pedophiles. Stabler offers five years with six months knocked off for each pedophile that is convicted.  She agrees to present him with the offer. Waters tells Benson and Stabler he met pedophiles the old-fashioned way. When he sees a guy in a kid-oriented place with no kids, he would ask him about a G-rated movie.Stabler makes his way downstairs and tells Maureen to quit hitting the computer. He tells her he put a child lock on it, but he will take it off so she can do her homework. When he cannot get it off, he asks for her help. After she gets it off, she asks him when he is going to start trusting her. He explains his current case and tells her this is about fear not trust. She asks him to stop reading her e-mail. He agrees and apologizes.Cragen explains he will be in the storage room with Benson and Jeffries. Stabler says the signal will be flashing the banquet room lights twice. Cragen tells them Stabler and Munch will be in the room. Eastman tells them they can say just about anything because the tape will not be used to convict anyone, but they need as many details as they can get so they can locate other witnesses.While Stabler and Munch get the pedophiles talking, Benson notes the details. When one pedophile offers product, the calvary arrives. Munch ends up with an undercover FBI agent.When Cragen gets to his office with the agent, he tells the agent he was working a sex crime in his jurisdiction and did not have the courtesy to tell him. The agent informs him they are in several places trying to get these guys and now the ones they arrested could be giving the others a heads up. Cragen muses the pedophiles are winning because while they are working together, law enforcement is not.Stabler draws Benson's attentions to the butterflies the prep drew on the pad. The prep tells them when the kids leaves the station they are in tears, but when they leave him they are all smiles."

While she is on the subway, a guy slams her into the end of the car and rapes her while everyone else acts as if they see nothing.Cragen tells them they have the C train line shut down and it is the same MO as a serial rapist. Jeffries explains the prep uses a box cutter, waits until the train is about at the station and then he takes off. Stabler says it is the seventh time in six months, but Benson points out it is the third time in one month.As they make their way to the scene, Jeffries asks Munch about his sour mood. He tells her it is his anniversary but he does not know which wife. The transit cop explains the attack took place between the Fulton and Chambers Street stations and they secured the scene as soon as they heard. The CSU tech tells them the paint on the metal resists fingerprints, but a couple hundred fingerprints on the window, a couple of partial footprints, and a coffee cup are their only pieces of evidence.Jen says she took a different train than her usual one. She denies seeing him before the attack. Stabler shows her a picture resembling the Unabomber, but she says it looks like him. She describes him as thin with sandy brown hair and a pointy, beak nose. He was wearing dark clothes and a hooded sweatshirt. She tells them he left his mark on her dress.Benson and Stabler question a witness. He reminds them that on the subway, people go blind to the things going on around them. He describes the guy as being 5-foot-10 wearing a hooded sweatshirt, a navy peacoat, and he had paint on his pants. Greenberg tells Munch and Jeffries this rape fit within the pattern of no pattern. The only profile they have is a guy that wants to get caught. He says they will put cameras in next year, but it will not stop a guy from putting his hand up a girl's skirt. Jeffries reminds him it was rape. Benson and Stabler question another witness. All she can tell them is he said something to the woman, but she doesn't know what.Cragen introduces Audrey Jackson, a shrink, to the group. The only similarity the victims have is they were all wearing skirts. She says the hunt is this guy's version of foreplay. The transit cop informs Munch and Jeffries this time the guy was caught thanks to other passengers and him.When Benson and Stabler question Bruce (the suspect) he tells them he fell against the woman. He has paint on his pants and claims it is from a window when he paints houses. Benson has him remove his pants. Stabler checks out the pants and notices a pocket missing and a DNA sample. Bruce claims his knife cut it. Cragen thinks he may be Catholic making him feel guilty about everything.Munch and Jeffries speak with the woman who screamed. She tells them that the girl was reading when the train jerked. Bruce grabbed onto the pole to keep from ramming into her. When he rubbed up against her, she screamed.Nick Ganzner meets Benson in the squad room to try to obtain information about the case. She does not give him anything but public information, but makes plans for a date that evening.When Munch and Jeffries question a witness, he states when he heard screaming and saw the guy rubbing against the girl he figured that it was the subway rapist he had heard about and put him in a full nelson.The doctor tells Munch and Jeffries that the woman says she was not raped and no evidence supports a rape allegation. The woman tells them he rubbed up against her but nothing else. She also states she has learned to read and keep alert about the things going on around her. And everyone should mind their own business. Surprisingly, she tells them a guy flashed her a few weeks prior.Jackson says he did not rape the woman. Cragen says he wants the other seven victims to come in for a line up and after some discussion agrees to have them transported in themselves. Only one of the women ID him. Jen reasons that it really does not matter if she IDs him or not since they have his DNA.When the ADA tells Cragen they can re-arrest him later if the DNA matches. Cragen wants to arrest him on a lesser charge to keep him off the streets. The ADA reminds him Bruce would not plead guilty on a lesser charge if he knows he can get off on a rape. Jackson says he will plead because he is guilty. Cragen tells her to go talk with him.Jackson informs him the police know he did not rape anyone. She inquires as to why he likes riding the subway. Jackson reminds his lawyer his job is to get him a good deal and hers is to make him feel better. Bruce tells her he is from South Dakota. He had relieved himself in an adult establishment prior to getting on the subway. He says he just wanted contact. Jackson tells Cragen Bruce is not their guy. The guy they are looking for wants to get caught, but the guy they are looking for does.At a bar, Ganzner tries to get information out of Benson about the case. She reminds him they are suppose to be on a date. She says she should write a book. He agrees saying she knows these people (referring to rapist). He tells her the reason people move away from her is because she gets inside rapists. When she gets up to leave, he informs her he is not going anywhere so she invites him over.At her place while they are kissing, she breaks away from kissing to put on jazz music. When he asks if she has sex with her eyes closed after everything she sees everyday, she tells him her eyes stay wide open. He suggests role-playing with him as the subway rapist. She stops his advances and tells him to be gone by the time she gets out from washing her hands and her mouth. Ganzner quickly removes a file from her desk before leaving.Benson walks into Cragen's office as he is reading the paper. He explains the reporter was able to get into the head of the rapist. She explains Ganzner was at her apartment and turned her back on him after asking him to leave. Cragen tells her to never turn her back on a reporter. She tells him she has learned her lesson and will take care of the problem with Ganzner. Munch walks in informing Cragen of another rape at Delancey Street station. Cragen tells him to take Jeffries.At the scene, the transit cop tells them a witness saw a card fall out of the perp's pocket onto the platform. After a little searching, they find a parking stub from Queens. At the parking lot, they are told the car is not there. Jeffries looks at the records and finds the car was picked up a few hours before. The attendant describes the rapist and tells them the guy drives different cars with Dewell's Painters Contractors. At Dewell's, they learn Sal Avelino is the only white guy who works there and they never know when he will come back when they send him on an errand.Munch and Jeffries take him to the station and log his possessions, including two driver's licenses, including one for Sidra Lonstein and a Metro card. When checking Avelino's travels, the computer freezes up.Sal's lawyer informs Cragen he wants to be number one in the line up. Jen identifies him immediately. Jeffries informs her they will contact her about testifying. Jen walks into the room full of witnesses waiting to identify the guy to get her scarf and tells everyone it was quick. Briscoe was not able to react fast enough to shut her up. In Cragen's office, Munch reminds Briscoe they were not suppose to talk. Briscoe says he cannot control six women at once, but he is okay in the field. Cragen tells him he needs to react faster. In court, all of the victim's identifications were thrown out causing the case to be dismissed.In the squad room, Stabler expresses the incredulity of the fact the judge could even think consensual sex could occur on the subway with a stranger holding a box cutter. Cragen tells them to locate Sidra Lonstein seeing as how she could be an uncontaminated complaining witness. Stabler opts to go with Munch considering Jeffries is watching Avelino work until she can arrest him.Munch and Stabler locate an older man who tells them Sidra is at work at a subway station five miles away. Benson goes to confront Ganzner at work. She tells him about getting reemed by Cragen saying it looks like she screwed up. She gives him a cold case file explaining it is about a man who uses women without the slightest twinge of regret like him. As she insults him, she ensures make her volume loud enough to where the entire office could hear the information. Munch and Stabler locate a pregnant Sidra and return her license. She explains she lost it when some guy bumped into her on the subway.Cragen, Munch, and Stabler make Sidra comfortable in Cragen's chair with her feet propped up. She tells them she is about 32-33 weeks pregnant. Stabler tells her he learned pregnancies are not actually nine months with his first child - it is more like 10. Cragen tries to ask if the ""bump"" was actually rape, but she denies it at first. She identifies Avelino. Cragen tells Stabler to take her to the vending machines for food. Stabler warns her of his cold, but she ignores his warning and takes his hand. Cragen tells Munch to bring Avelino in for questioning.Munch tells Avelino he has a court order for an amniocentesis on a complaining witness. He realizes that must mean someone is pregnant. Munch and Jeffries explain that even though he got away with the other rapes, he won't get away with this one. The amniocentesis will nail him for this rape. In the squad room, Stabler asks Sidra if she is feeling all right. She says she is. When he tells her he is now that she has touched him, she looks at him strangely. Munch and Jeffries bring Avelino through. When he sees Sidra, he admits to the rape in front of everyone."

Perry|1|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/remorse-12345/recap|http://www.tv.com|"Sarah Logan, a field reporter on the news, tells her audience of being raped. She tells them the police have been working her case for 12 weeks with no leads. She asks for their help. She describes one as having a tattoo of a star on his wrists and smelling like cigarettes and the other wore a running suit. She tells her audience she is going to fight back. A woman watching the news realizes the guy she is with could be one of them, but when she tries to call the police, he stops her. When she does talk to Benson and Stabler, she tells them he is Mark Krieger, a car parts sales rep from Cleveland. She gives them the key to her room. When they go in, he is puking in the toilet. As Benson attempts to read him his rights, he tells her the city will have to pay for his lawyer because he is broke before he pukes again causing Benson to excuse herself.Stabler tells the team Krieger works in construction and has priors including possession, assaults stemming mostly from bar fights, and kiting checks. Benson tells them he is from Queens, but he told his date different. Stabler informs them the girl knows she was almost the next victim of Mr. Goodbar. Benson tells them he lawyered up immediately. After Munch tells them he always thought it was a crime of opportunity, Jeffries tells them the perps did not even know who Sarah was. Cragen informs them they may end up having to file against Krieger and ""an un-apprehended other,"" but he wants to find the other guy before Krieger gives him a heads up. Cragen tells them to check phone records, employment records, credit card bills, and find the other guy. When the meeting breaks up, Munch asks Cragen if anyone notified Sarah about the suspect. He tells him he thought he should tell her himself.When Munch goes to tell Sarah about the arrest, she asks if he saw her piece on the news. He tells her it took guts to do that. She asks him to tell her the guy's name, but he reminds her it would jeopardize the line-up. He assures her he will tell her everything when it is over. He informs her she probably will not see the guy again until court.While Munch and Jeffries search Krieger's apartment, Jeffries guesses he only works as often as he has to. Munch tears part of a poster containing phone numbers. They figure his ashtray collection is from his one-night stands so they take them. They realize the second rapist could be one of opportunity.In the squad room, Cragen interrupts Benson and Stabler as they look at the bars advertised on the ashtrays. He reminds them of his drinking days. Benson asks him which one is closest to the attack. He responds with Shad's Cabaret adding it is just a bunch of hard working locals and confused out-of-towners. He asks that they let him know if anything has changed. While Munch tells them he came up empty on his calls, Jeffries tells him she found one that knows Krieger.   When Jeffries and Munch talk with Krieger's cousin, P.K., he informs them he has not seen him since Labor Day. He tells them Krieger is always getting into trouble. Stabler finds Krieger owes Shad's Cabaret $36, but he used his credit card. When the owner cannot tell him what Krieger bought, Stabler explains the drinks would tell him if he was drinking alone or with someone. The owner tells him the only information on the receipt is the date of January 11th. Sarah walks into the line-up and is introduced to everyone. Cragen explains the men will not be able to see her. Munch adds if she does not recognize anyone she needs to make sure before saying so. At her request, Cragen asks the men to roll up their sleeves and turn their wrists out. When all of them have the tattoo, she gets a little confused, but points out number three.As Munch escorts her from the line-up, he tells her the man's name is Mark Krieger and he is a welder from Queens. After he tells her they interrogated Krieger but he did not talk, she asks him if they can make a deal with him to give up the other rapist. He reminds her his lawyer will not let them talk to him. When she tells him she wants to know why the chose her, he tells her rapists give excuses they hear on television and in movies to judges and journalists after they are convicted. The truth is she will never know why they chose her and they may never catch the second guy. Cragen informs the team he has received three calls in two days from One Police Plaza inquiring as to where they are on Sarah's case. Munch informs him they have DNA, a witness placing him in the neighborhood, and Sarah. Cragen reminds them they still do not have the second guy and it has been almost a month. Stabler informs him they have checked employers, landlords, and every bar he ever stole an ashtray at and got nothing. Benson informs him Krieger did not keep friends any longer than he needed them. When Cragen asks if they have any longshots, Stabler tells him he received a call from an informant in Rikers saying he heard something from someone. At Rikers, Stabler tells his informant he was able to get his daughter's teacher to cut her some slack and do summer school and he has the principal looking out for her. His informant tells him Krieger is scared he is going down on this one, but he did not know who Sarah was when he did it. When asked about the second guy, the only thing he knows is the guy was already in Rikers on a DUI charge or something like that. When Krieger found him he told him to keep quiet or he will kill him. Stabler asks a jail administrator for a list of everyone in the day Krieger came in. She tells him that would be 16,000 names. He asks her to rule out women and children and narrows it to 12,000 men. When she asks him what he actually needs, he tells her he needs everyone who came into contact with Krieger narrowing it to 6,204 possibilities. After he is denied his request to narrow it down by age and race, she hands him a disk.ADA Alden explains to Munch that Defense Attorney Sorenson will try to rush the case to trial in order to catch them unprepared. When Munch tells her they are ready, she reminds him Sarah says she was raped by two men, but they will only be able to show the jury one. Sarah took an unusual route home so he will try to say it was more than a leisurely walk home. She reminds him they do not have semen, but he reminds her a condom was used. She does not believe Sarah is ready so she suggests he ask for Benson's help in prepping Sarah.Benson tells Sarah the defense cannot bring up her sexual history on the stand, but they may be able to allude to it. She informs her the defense does not have to prove it did not happen as long as they can muddy the waters a little. Munch tells her they will try to beat her up on the stand. They explain she will have to be detailed explaining where each person was, each body part, and explain how she could tell which guy it was. Benson tells her to answer with simple and direct answers. She tells her to use the actual names for body parts and if they make her uncomfortable talk to her or Munch until she is comfortable. In court, the defense files 4 motions, including one to exclude the witness identification, and the prosecution files one to exclude press from the courtroom. The judge states he will rule in the morning. In the hallway, Sarah questions why they are trying to exclude her identification. ADA Alden explains their only hope is to try to convince the judge and jury that everyone from the police to the witness is incompetent. Sarah responds by asking Munch to come on her show stating it has already been cleared with Cragen. Munch tries to talk his way out of it saying a woman is who she needs to have if the subject is rape. She tells him that if her audience sees him, they will be more likely to go to the police. After she bribes him with dinner after the show, he reminds her not to say the word ""bribe"" to a cop in a crowded courthouse.While Munch is waiting at the studio for Sarah, he is told there is some gridlock by her neighborhood. When he receives a call, he leaves to go to her apartment. When he arrives, a firefighter tries to stop him from going in citing the building is not safe. When he makes his way past the firefighter, Benson stops him letting him know it was Sarah. She tells him the neighbors heard a single blast. The bomb squad got the call at 6:46 and arrived at 6:52. She informs him the six minutes would not have mattered. When Munch gets to her apartment, he is told it was a black powder bomb in a box of flowers. She saw the flowers at her door and brought them in. When she opened them, she blocked the blast from the north side of the room with her body killing her instantly.When Munch arrives at work, he tells Jefferies he stayed at the scene late and Benson is still there canvassing. Cragen slowly makes his way to his three remaining detectives and asks for an update. Stabler informs them his source told him the second guy was in Rikers when they got Krieger. He narrowed the field of possibilities by age and description before narrowing it further to those who were out when the rape occurred leaving 207 men. When Munch clarifies they are going on the assumption the second guy is the bomber, he then reminds them Sarah's testimony is out unless they suggest Krieger masterminded the bombing. Stabler adds Krieger could not mastermind a church picnic. Cragen tells Munch and Jeffries to work on the rape, and tells Stabler to work on the bombing with Benson and only share information with Munch about Krieger. Cragen requests Munch's presence in his office to see if he needs time off which he declines.Benson and Stabler are informed the bomb was made from a soup can, Chinese black powder, and a flammable liquid held together with masking tape wired to a remote. Benson explains the guy used a bomb instead of a gun, put it in a romantic box of flowers, and used a remote instead of a switch. Stabler picks up on where she is going realizing the guy had her life in his hands. When he asks if the park across the street from her apartment was searched, he is told they did not know to look there. He suggests the guy wanted to watch her die.While looking at the park, Stabler picks up a wrapper from a pile of throat lozenge wrappers thinking the guy may have had a cold. Benson notes the guy would have been able to see right into her apartment. The guy had to buy the supplies, make the bomb, deliver it, and kill her. They realize the perps each have their own motive and MO. One is a planner and Krieger joins in at the last minute. They realize Krieger went along just for the ride.In court, Sorenson asks the judge to quash the indictment since Sarah is dead. ADA Alden asks they allow her journals and statements to the police in under Geraci. The judge tells her they have seven days to link Krieger to the bombing or the indictment will be quashed. After Sorenson asks for his client to let out so he can help with his defense, the judge sets bail at $50,000. Munch expresses his disdain for the decision and is fined for contempt. He only stops when the judge threatens to put him in lock-up with the next word. Jefferies ushers Munch out of the courtroom citing a call she received from Krieger's cousin.P.K. tells Munch and Jefferies he remembers a friend of Krieger's from selling pot named Tommy. He adds his last name is something Irish. When he asks if he will get the reward, Munch throws some money at him telling him to go buy himself a blunt. After locating 18 men fitting their requirements, Munch and Jefferies try Shad's Cabaret to see if he was there drinking with Krieger. After seeing a picture of Krieger and a photo array, the owner picks out Tommy McConaghWhile Jeffries acts like she is trying to pump gas unsuccessfully, Munch approaches the window complaining his wife cannot get gas and he has to be at work. When McConagh heads for the door, Benson, Stabler, and Munch meet him there with guns out to arrest him. Stabler explains to McConagh in the interrogation room that he knows about the pot bust, but does not care about that. He reminds him he was in jail for a week when Krieger approaches him and tells him not to talk about the night they went partying at Shad's. He informs him that he will be the one going down for murder since Krieger is pinning it all on him unless he tells his story. McConagh tells him they were high and he dares Krieger to pick the lock to the swimming pool. Krieger tells him it would be a good lace to do a girl. He attacks Sarah, but he did not watch. Stabler remind him he is Irish and was raised to respect women. McConagh admits to watching the rape. In the viewing room, Jeffries comments that Krieger's bail has been revoked. Munch tells her ""Let's go."" At Krieger's apartment, Krieger takes off running when he hears Munch and Jefferies. Krieger gets into a van and just before Jefferies gets to him, the van explodes knocking her down. Munch moves Jefferies to safety telling her he will call Cragen.Munch, Benson, and Stabler are told the bomb was the same as the one in Sarah's apartment. After they are told the guy could have been 50 feet away, they check on Jeffries. When Munch asks her to take a few days, she agrees.Stabler informs the team that the canvas is coming up empty. They discuss it may be a case where the guy thought he had a relationship with her and did not believe she should be talking about her rape on television. Cragen tells them to look through her correspondence after her story aired. Stabler tells Cragen McConagh flipped on Krieger, but admitted nothing himself. After reminding him McConagh does not know Krieger died, Cragen decides to play the disappointed father figure.After Cragen tells McConagh he knows he lied to Stabler, he asks what happened that night. McConagh tells him he held Sarah down while Krieger raped her. She asked them not to hurt her. He admits he raped her next using a condom. When she is still crying her asks her what more does she want since he used the condom.While they are searching Sarah's mail, Munch brings up the powder used in making the bombs. Benson realizes they can test for the powder residue so they all drop the mail and take it to the lab. They find a card in a red envelope. After Munch notices they did not sign it, they spray for  fingerprints. After running the prints through the criminal databases and city employees, they come up empty. Cragen tells them to run the prints through the weeds of prospective employees. They come up with Wlliam Lexner. He graduated from Queens College in 1984 and was rejected from the Fire Department six times with the most recent time being in '99. Munch reads from the psych report that he is narcissistic and thinks he has enemies preventing him from being hired by the Fire Department. Cragen tells them he wants to try to take him without incident, but plans to take the bomb squad as a precaution.After evacuating the rest of the building, Munch and Stabler are asked if they want suits. When Munch tells him he is wearing one, they are told bomb suits only make them better looking corpses making Stabler more nervous. Stabler knocks on the door claiming to have a certified check for him saying he needs a signature and it will take 6 to 8 weeks for re-delivery. When Stabler gets a few feet from the door, Lexner comes out. Munch pulls his gun while Stabler overpowers him. Cragen tells Munch they will not be able to make the case on forensics alone. They need a confession. When Munch introduces himself to Lexner, he recognizes him as the cop who handled Sarah's case. Munch tells him he is more interesting than the rape cases he handles every day. Lexner tells him rape is the worst crime of all because guys will be with the women who have not been raped before the ones who have. Munch tells him it should not matter if you care. Munch concludes Lexner saw Sarah differently after the rape. He confirms this stating she never smiled the same. Munch tells him she was a good woman who did good deeds. When Lexner asks what she was like, he told him Sarah mentioned him twice saying they clicked. Lexner tells him he wanted Sarah to be happy like she once was. He ordered the flowers she would have wanted and wrapped the box in a gold ribbon like she would have wanted and left it in front of her building. He was in the park and watched the 5:00 news. He watched her take the box to her apartment and watched for her smile before he flipped the switch."

They are told the pictures were dropped off by Larry Holt 45 minutes earlier. After seeing an open bottle of alcohol in one of the pictures, Benson believes the only charge will be Endangering the Welfare of a Child. They decide they will follow him for a few weeks, but Holt arrives to pick up his pictures so they arrest him.Cragen looks at the pictures and tells Benson and Stabler they do not even have Holt on Endangering because they cannot prove the liquid in the bottle was not apple juice. Stabler points out the boy's shorts were too short and he had to be told to drop his chin. When Cragen suggests he could be in the pageant circuit, Stabler reminds him boys do not usually go Jonbenet. Stabler tells him guys that take those kinds of pictures are going to keep them. Benson informs ADA Hickey that Holt is the boy's piano teacher. Stabler believes there are more pictures and he wants a warrant to search Holt's home. Holt's attorney interrupts them because Holt told him they took his keys and wallet. Cragen tells him they voucher all personal property for safe keeping. When the attorney asks for Holt's keys, Cragen asks why he needs them. He claims he needs to feed the dog, but Cragen tells him the dog will be fine before finally telling him the Property Clerk has them. Once he is gone, Benson removes a brown envelope from her desk containing the items in question. Cragen tells them he will put a uniform at Holt's door. Hickey tells them if they get probable cause, they will have their warrant. Benson and Stabler head out to the small neighborhood.When Benson and Stabler arrive at Holt's, they see the uniform officer trying to explain to Holt's son that no one is allowed inside. Stabler explains they have a warrant pending in front of a judge and the premises will remain locked down until she rules. He accepts this and leaves. They question why a rich, white man would move into this neighborhood across from an elementary school. When a little boy runs up to them and tries to get past them, they stop him. He explains he has piano lessons when they ask him where he is going. Stabler compares the picture of the little boy to the boy standing before him and realizes they are the same one.In the interview room, Jonathan tells Benson that Holt puts his hand on his back while he plays for posture. When he tells her his dad told him the touching was okay, his father informs her that is the way Holt teaches the kids in the neighborhood. Jonathan tells her Holt has taken pictures of him while he played, but he found some snappies of naked boys when he turned a sheet of music. From the other side of the one-way, Hickey tells Stabler and Cragen they now have their probable cause and he will call in a favor with Judge Rothman. Cragen tells Stabler to go with Hickey and they will go in while the ink is still drying.After Rothman signs the warrant including all forms of media, Stabler calls Benson to tell them they can go in. While Benson looks through a chest of sheet music, she locates a photo album containing pictures of boys at various stages of undress. As Munch looks around, he notices a disguised door and forces it open. He makes his way to the television and VCR and starts the tape. As he is watching, Benson and Jeffries make their way in the room to see Holt abusing a boy as he plays piano. The tape is turned off and the lights are turned on revealing shelves full of videos.    In court, the judge verifies 43 photos in the album were obscene and 157 tapes were found. He charges Holt with Endangering the Welfare of a Child, Use of a Child in a Sexual Performance, Promoting an Obscene Sexual Performance by a Child, and 44 counts of Possessing Obscene Sexual Performance by a Child. When Holt's attorney reminds the judge the prosecution has not had time to inventory all of the cassette tapes, the judge tells him they will all dread the discovery process before denying bail.The team gathers in front of the television and VCR to view the tape found in Holt's VCR. They believe they are watching different children until the boy rubs his eyebrow in each segment after the first causing them to realize it is the same boy suffering from thirteen years of abuse. Stabler stops the tape as Hickey arrives. Cragen reminds him they usually hear about the abuse after it happens. Benson adds to see it is different. Munch volunteers to watch the remaining tapes. Cragen tells Hickey they need Holt's computer, day planner, and his schedule. Hickey tells them that in order to get Holt on abuse they need a kid. Cragen specifies they need the kid on the tape.Seven detectives armed with pictures of the kid on the tape knock on doors in the neighborhood asking if anyone knows him. Time after time, they are told they should ask Holt. The clerk at the store tells Stabler Holt is fruity touching everyone and everything. The clerk at the video store tells Jeffries his kids get free lessons and tell him Holt is strict. He tells her Holt taught Rey Guzimano. He believes Holt makes more of a difference in people's lives than she will.Jeffries believes the people know. Stabler thinks they were trying to be optimistic. Benson suggests they were too busy trying to survive. When Jeffries leaves to speak with someone, Benson tries to read his mind saying even the best parents cannot protect their kids. He tells her he was thinking he ha a gutter that needs to be fixed, but continues saying parents wish they could feel all of the pain for their kids. When Benson questions why have them at all, he explains you want them more than anything and you want to love them every day. When they arrive in front of Holt's home, they hear someone playing piano. They find Evan oblivious to their presence finishing a piece. When they gain his attention, he informs them he has keys. After they compliment his playing, they show him the picture from the video. While he looks at the picture, he rubs his eyebrow causing them to realize they found the kid in the video.In the interview, Evan tells Benson and Stabler he has an audition for Julliard thanks to Holt. Holt pushed him by making him practice. He would set the bar higher and each time Evan made it. Evan denies Holt ever hurt him.When Stabler tells Cragen and Hickey Evan did not know he was video taped, Cragen suggests showing him the tape. Stabler warns him there will be more pain for Evan if they do. He questions if the currents charges against Holt will be enough. Hickey tells him Holt will only get seven years. Stabler warns them again that viewing the tape will ruin Evan's life. Cragen reminds him Evan is an adult before leaving with Hickey to show Evan the tape.Cragen warns Evan what he will see on the tape is wrong, but they need the other person on the tape to help them. When Evan sees the video, he asks them to turn it off and backs into the corner before turning around and crying into the wall. Cragen tries to comfort him when he slides down to the floor. Stabler opens the door and looks at Cragen.As Benson and Stabler approach Evan's home, they discuss Holt's characteristics of being rich, white, and educated caused the kids to want to be a part of his world where he can love them. When they tell Evan's mother they want to speak with him about playing piano, she tells them if they are from the school then they need to talk to him about who is going to pay for it. In the kitchen, they ask him to help with the identities of the kids in the other pictures in the photo album. He tells them Holt's cabinet doors close unlike his own. The middle school's piano is missing a D-Flat and is always out of tune while Holt's is nice. He tells them there is a price to pay for everything. Benson asks again for help with the pictures. He tells them Holt cared about him and bought him a coat one year. When he informs them Rey Guzimano made his first CD at 17, Benson reminds him Julliard accepted a 41-year-old flute player the year before. He reminds her the guy was a monk. He grabs the album and turns to a picture identifying the boy as Caesar. He is in jail because his gun accidentally went off when a dry cleaner was opening the register. He turns to another picture identifying him as Ricky, who is currently a junkie. He locates another picture identifying him as Tony and no one knows where he is.Jeffries informs the team Holt did not have a computer, a day planner, or a set schedule. Cragen clarifies there is no evidence anyone helped Holt. When Hickey reminds them the tapes have dates on them, Stabler clarifies the dates are the beginning of the lessons. Jeffries informs them the current students and their families are not talking. Hickey informs them the case is being fast-tracked and Evan's two counts of abuse are being tried separately. Cragen and Hickey explain the change in the law in 1996 did not come with a grandfather clause and abuse can only be prosecuted until the age of 23, but everything before 1996 is inadmissible and anything after the age of 17 is consensual. Stabler informs them Evan does not want to betray Holt and worries people will hate him. When Cragen suggests they talk with the kids Evan knows, Stabler tells him Caesar the lifer or Ricky the junkie making him realize it would not help.Ricky tells Benson Holt never touched him. He quit playing because he did not have technique or discipline. He tells her if Holt's door was ever locked, they could come back for a meal, sugar cookie, and warmth. Guzimano tells Jeffries he does not owe the community anything. Holt was the only one who ever told him he could do anything. There are only three ways to get out of the neighborhood: smart enough to figure it out, get out on your own, or you are good at something. Holt's son tells Stabler he will not talk to him because Holt is his father. Cragen finds Munch still in front of the television. Munch tells him every time he closes his eyes he sees every frame of the tapes. Cragen tells him to go home. Munch contemplates the better part of Homicide...bodies that do not talk back. Cragen reminds him of his attempt to retire from Baltimore only to end up in another squad room in New York. When he says he will do a better job of quitting this time, Cragen believes he is running and sends him home again. Munch tells him he has two more tapes to watch. While Stabler reads 'Twas the Night Before Christmas with Dickie and Lizzie, Dickie questions if their stockings will be filled. As Stabler checks his beeping pager, he explains Christmas comes once a year and it is now February. He asks Lizzie to hand him the phone. She hands it to him as they ask why Christmas cannot come all the time. He dials the number saying Santa's credit cards are maxed out. He tells Evan to stay put and he will be there as soon as he can.Evan tells Stabler his mother kicked him out because she thinks he is gay. Stabler explains he knows places that will help him get on his feet. When he asks about his job, Evan tells him washing dishes damaged his hands, but he was fired. After Evan tells him he wants to testify, he asks if Stabler thinks he is gay. Stabler explains he probably does not know yet. It is not something you choose. When he is ready, he will see someone with love.Stabler closes the piano startling Kathy. When she asks him what is going on at work, he tells her nothing. She asks him if he talked to Benson about it. He reminds her that Benson is his partner.Stabler asks Hickey how to make Evan more comfortable in the courtroom. Hickey tells him Evan answers questions like a kid trying to find the right answer. Stabler reminds him Evan shut down at 8-years-old. Hickey suggests they give Evan a tour of the courtroom. After Evan spins around in the judge's chair and bangs the gavel, they have him sit on the witness stand. Hickey explains he will not be allowed in the courtroom because his testimony may become contaminated. He tells him to look at only him and answer the questions as they practiced. When Holt's lawyer asks him questions, he is to answer them and ignore everything else.When Stabler returns to the squad room, Munch asks if Holt made a conscious choice or if he was abused. Stabler tells him it is just another excuse. Holt hurt a lot of kids and that is his concern. Munch tells him he has something to show him. They end up in front of the television with a video of Evan and Jonathan. When Holt comes in and tells Evan Jonathan is ready, Stabler sits down and continues watching in anger as Evan abuses Jonathan.Jeffries believes Evan has been through enough. Benson reminds her that in this case Evan is the abuser. Munch tells them Evan is both. Cragen wonders who is next stating if Evan hurts another kid then they are responsible. Benson tells them in a few years Evan will be Holt. Cragen calls Hickey to come over after telling them the same laws apply to Evan as they do to Holt.Evan explains Holt told him if Jonathan had never felt longing then he could not play a piece about longing. When Stabler tells him Jonathan was playing The Entertainer, Evan responds that was how he was taught. He promises it only happened once. When he is told he committed a crime, he tells them he deserves to be punished. Cragen tells him they may be able to work out a deal. As Cragen and Stabler leave the interrogation room, Cragen asks him if he thinks they should not make a deal with Evan. Cragen explains they are stuck in the middle. When he reminds Stabler they watched him be subjected to horrible things, Stabler questions if he is talking about Jonathan or Evan successfully proving his point. Stabler believes the abuse Evan suffered relieves him of too much responsibility because he made the choice to commit a crime. Cragen theorizes Stabler is being eaten up because of the lack of choice the little boy Evan had.In court, the judge sets bail at $25,000 causing a side bar. When they explain Evan is a key witness in their case against Holt and the stress of a night in jail may effect his testimony, the judge releases him into the custody of the people until his testimony is complete.   In the hotel room, Stabler tells Evan he does not hate him, but when he looks at him instead of seeing the victim he sees the abuser. While he is unpacking, he pulls out the book he and the twins were reading and throws it on the bed. When Evan picks it up and starts reading it, Stabler takes it away.In court, Evan tells them Holt would sit next to him on the piano bench and touch his back for posture. When Hickey asks if Holt ever touched him anywhere else, Evan answered in the affirmative.At the sentencing hearing, the judge asks if Holt would like to say anything. When he does not, she tells him she sees nothing that tells her he is remorseful after having stolen the hope from the children. She sentences him to 115 years. Hickey tells Evan Holt will be eligible for parole in thirty years.Hickey, Stabler, and Cragen try to explain Evan's deal to Jonathan's father. They want to spare Jonathan from being on the stand. Evan will be on heavily supervised probation. Jonathan's father threatens to take the story to the media if they keep the deal.Evan hands Stabler the envelope from Julliard. Stabler feels the weight and congratulates him. Hickey informs Evan and his lawyer the judge will not accept the deal. Hickey tells Evan a felony carries one to three years in jail. His lawyer believes he will get probation if they go to trial and withdraws the guilty plea. Evan does not want Jonathan to have to go to court. He tells them he does not know why Holt is the way he is, but he knows why he is the way he is and he wants the cycle to stop now.
Ted Kotcheff|22|22|2000-05-19 00:00:00|E0926|Slaves||Dawn DeNoon & Lisa Marie Petersen|1|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/slaves-12347/recap|http://www.tv.com|"Cragen enters the squad room telling the team that One Police Plaza has decided to have biyearly psych evaluations. To pilot the program, SVU will be the guinea pig. He hands them each a folder, tells them to fill it out, and the resident psychologist will set up the appointments. After Cragen tells them he does not know where they are going with this, Benson asks who is first. He tells them he will be first. When Stabler asks Benson if she believes this, she tells him they may need it. The Romanian owner of a fruit stand on Lex and 78th interrupts them to report a sex crime. He explains that after two boys steal bananas from him, a woman begs him to help her. She is trapped in a situation with a man she cannot escape. He believes there is both physical and sexual abuse. He tells them he does not know her name or address, but she hands him a piece of paper with the name ""Constanta Condrescu"" and asks him to tell her she was right that she needs help before taking off. When Stabler asks what time this happened, he tells him three days ago.While the fruit vendor works with a sketch artist, Cragen tries to understand the case. Some girl is being abused by some guy somewhere in Manhattan. Stabler explains Mircha, the fruit vendor, came to the states a few years ago and he has never been in trouble. Benson tells them he accidentally told his wife about it and she would not shut up until he came in. Benson reminds Cragen many women are abused by their other half and never report it so they at least need to investigate. Munch agrees giving a comparison to ""Deep Throat.""Benson and Stabler shows Constanta the sketch and ask if she knows her. When she denies it, Stabler reminds her how rare her name is. She finally admits the girl is Ilena, her niece. Ilena came to the states three years prior on a student visa and she has not seen her since. She tells them she does not know where she is. Before they leave, Benson gives Constanta her card and asks her to call if she can think of anything else. As they make their way to the car, Stabler calls in for a check on Ilena after telling Benson they at least found out her name and got an actual picture. When Stabler says unless Ilena flunked out or quit she should still be at NYU, Benson calls Munch to have him check with NYU.Munch is told Ilena never showed up at NYU. When he asks if they have the reason why in her file, he is shown the file room of student records. Audrey Jackson closes the blinds to the room she is using for the evaluations. Cragen tells her he feels like a prep. When they take their seats, she asks him about golf and what he does to relax. He gets fed up with the dance and tells her to go ahead and ask him about his alcoholism. He tells her he gets the urge to drink after what he sees every day. When Jackson asks if he will drink, he tells her to ask him tomorrow and walks out.When Benson and Stabler show Ilena's picture to a clown in the park amking balloons, he tells them he sees her all the time. He informs them she has gained some weight since the picture, but he is positive it is her. She is the nanny of an eight or nine year old. He last saw her the day prior.When Benson and Stabler inform Cragen the clown saw her serene the day before, Cragen tries to make sense of it. Three days prior she is slipping an S.O.S. to a fruit vendor and a few days later she is strolling happily through the park with a kid. While Stabler answers his ringing phone, Cragen explains he wants Ilena in the station explaining herself after wasting 32 combined man-hours. Stabler announces Homicide caught a dump job off the Henry Hudson with Benson's card in the pocket.When Benson and Stabler arrive on the scene, they are told the body was wrapped in a rug and probably dumped the previous night. There are no witnesses because people always dump stuff. She was found by a fisherman thinking he found a present for his wife. When they see the body, they confirm her identity as Constanta Condrescu. Stabler guesses she found a way to contact Ilena.The ME informs Benson and Stabler Constanta was dead before she was put on the rug. Something injected into her bloodstream caused her heart to stop beating instantly without effecting the other organs, but he cannot find a puncture wound. After explaining he checked all of the usual concealed places, Benson asks if he checked under the tongue. As he is telling her that would make sense for an accidental overdose but not for a killer, he checks and finds the puncture wound.During the team meeting, Stabler suggests the victim had to be sedated for the killer to inject at that location. Cragen does not understand Constanta sharing a spiked drink with the perp after learning Ilena is in trouble. Stabler guesses she did since she was dead two hours after they left her. Munch tells them Ilena's father was murdered in Romania in '89 and believes the two are linked. Cragen tells him to start the investigation in Murray Hill.As the team searches Constanta's home, Benson finds an unfinished cup of tea. Stabler finds her address book opened to the Cs with a page missing. Munch and Jefferies inform them the neighbors did not know her and they never saw the niece. Benson hands them a shoe box and tells them they may have better luck with her work.At the restaurant, Jeffries is told Ilena never came there. Constanta was saving to bring Ilena from Romania, but Ilena met a businessman who agreed to help. He used his frequent flyer miles for her ticket and told her of a part-time job. Constanta tried to tell Ilena there would be a catch. She tried to contact her through the man, but he told her he had not heard from her. She kept trying before finally giving up.During Benson's evaluation, she tells Jackson she is the child of rape. Although sometimes she gets too close to a case, she never loses her objectivity. When Jackson asks about her use of deadly force, Benson tells her Stabler was about to be shot and reacted as she was trained. Benson does not answer when Jackson asks her what she would do if she could not work sex crimes.When Benson arrives at the lab, Stabler asks how it went with Jackson. After she responds it was a cakewalk, he looks at her as if he doubts the accuracy of her answer. They are told the rug is a Persian Keshan costing about $5000. She found dirt, cotton fibers, and a hair with an intact root that does not belong to the victim. Although they cannot prove it is the prep's, they still desire a perp to compare it to.Munch and Jeffries check Air Bucharest for Ilena's flight information. When a phone starts ringing, Munch tells the man not to answer it before he is informed it is his phone. While Munch is on the phone, Jefferies suggests they check flights from Romania to JFK. They find the frequent flyer is Randolph Morrow.When Benson and Stabler are knocking at the front door of the Morrow residence, Ilena comes out another door on the ground. When they tell her they got her message to her aunt, she claims she does not know what they are talking about. After a little girl runs up to Ilena, they move the conversation inside. She tells them the Morrows are good to her. She informs them they are at work and she must have dinner ready by the time they get home. Benson informs her that her aunt was murdered an hour after they told her she was in trouble. Ilena tells them she never sent the message. Stabler tells her they know her aunt came to see her. Ilena claims she has not seen her aunt in three years and repeats she has to have dinner ready when they get home. Before they leave, Stabler offers his condolences. Benson asks her why she never started at NYU causing the door to shut in their faces.When Benson and Stabler inform the team the only time Ilena showed any emotion was at the thought of dinner being late, Jackson tells them it is the Stockholm Syndrome. After Jackson and Munch fill them in on what they are talking about, Jackson informs them it only takes 72 hours to break down a person's psyche through threats of death, isolation, and random acts of kindness. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to find out what is going on in that house.During Munch's evaluation, Jackson asks if he dates and if working in the unit effects his ability to function sexually. After joking his way through, he tells her he has a hard time talking about himself and asks what she thinks. She notes his multiple marriages to beautiful, spoiled women saying none of them matched him intellectually. She tells him he does not trust women or the government and he can smell a conspiracy at a five year old's lemonade stand. She adds he has given up on relationships, but believes in true love and the pain of never having found it is unbearable.Benson and Stabler walk with the Morrows' neighbors as they walk their dog. They believe the Morrows are good neighbors and decent parents. When Benson asks about Ilena, they are told she has been with them for one year. They tell them Mrs. Morrow is a veterinarian and Mr. Morrow is an investment banker.Randolph Morrow tells Benson and Stabler Ilena told him about her aunt but denies ever meeting her or knowing she was around. He informs them he met Ilena while on a business trip to Romania. She wanted to come to the states and he needed a nanny so he brought her back with him three years ago. While Benson tells him his neighbors are positive Ilena has only been here a year and he reminds her it is New York, his secretary brings in some drinks only to have him order her to lower the blinds. Before they leave, he tells them he was in a meeting with four corporate lawyers on Monday between four and six. As they leave, Benson notices hairs on his jacket. Acting as if she is just being nice, she plucks a few. Once outside, Stabler compliments her on her method of collecting DNA. Stabler receives a call telling them Constanta was killed with Beuthanasia. He clarifies the drug is used to put animals to sleep.Dr. Morrow tells Benson and Stabler she was at home on Monday. She tells them her husband was not there and denies Ilena had any visitors. After Dr. Morrow asks Barry to help her, Stabler asks how things are working out with Ilena. While she retrieves a pill from the medicine cabinet she tells him they have a routine, but her husband can explain it better. Stabler asks her if she and Ilena got along when she has to retrieve the pill she dropped. She tells him her husband selected her to help her. Dr. Morrow tells them they should talk to her husband when Benson asks how close he and Ilena are. They are interrupted by news of a hit-and-run accident. She asks Barry to take over for her before excusing herself. When Stabler compliments the facility, Barry tells them they have their own O.R., recovery rooms, and a pharmacy down the hall. He explains the DEA does not monitor them as closely as they do humans. When they ask about vets getting addicted, Barry ends the conversation. Stabler gives him his card and tells him to call if he wants to tell them anything else.During Jeffries's evaluation, Jackson asks about her close call with the explosion. Jeffries explains she does not hesitate, but is more confident saying she feels alive. She tells her she was in a long-term relationship before starting with the unit and has been celibate until the accident. She tells her she goes out with a lot of men. After hesitating, she decides to tell her about meeting a former suspect in a bar and going home with him. Munch sees Jeffries and asks if she is okay because Jackson had him wanting to eat his gun. She unconvincingly tells him she is fine before walking off. When Barry asks Munch for Benson or Stabler, he escorts him to them.Barry explains when Valium or Ketamine come up missing it is normal because of the stress. He tells them Dr. Morrow took Beuthanasia home a few months ago. He explains you cannot mistake it because it is bright pink.Dr. Morrow tells Benson and Stabler the Beuthanasia was for her personal use. When Benson asks if she wanted the drug because her husband was sleeping with Ilena, she tells her sexuality is about reaching our limits and transcending them. Stabler asks if her husband transcended Ilena's aunt. She tells them Constanta showed up at her door, threatened her husband, and threatened her routine so she calmed her down with tea. She tells them her husband did not have to tell her to kill Constanta.After they receive no response from pounding on the Morrows' door, Benson and Stabler break the glass to gain entry. Once inside, they smell something coming from upstairs. When they reach the room, they see Morrow burning pictures. Stabler cuffs him while Benson tries to salvage as many pictures as possible. Morrow tells Stabler Ilena is gone for good. Not believing him, Stabler and Benson begin searching the house calling her name. When they find a door with a padlock, they break it open and reveal a restraint system.In the interrogation room, Benson asks Morrow where the girl in the picture is. He tells her he would like a mineral water without ice. She responds she would like his balls in a blender. When he tells her he would like some quiet time, she excuses herself to catch up on some typing. Once she is out of the room, Stabler tells him he should not have called her ""honey."" When Stabler tells him he has been trying to break her in, Morrow suggests the excruciatingly painful rack. He adds it has to be consensual like it is with Ilena. Cragen interrupts them escorting Morrow's attorney. When the attorney gets upset about Stabler questioning his client, Morrow tells him they were discussing common interests. Cragen stops Stabler to let him know the hair from the rug belongs to Dr. Morrow. Stabler returns to the squad room telling Benson they need the warrant now because they need to find Ilena before she dies.ADA Alden explains to the judge the detectives entered the apartment believing a woman was in imminent danger when they saw the pictures. She tells him they found evidence she was being held against her will and recently moved. The judge reminds her of the amount of bondagfe shops in the city stating possession does not mean it was non-consensual. He denies the warrant. Benson and Stabler locate Dr. Morrow in the hospital de-toxing from Ketamine after long-term use. When they suggest her husband tortured Ilena, she corrects them saying he disciplined her. They tell her Ilena is missing and the only one left to put in the closet is their adopted daughter. She explains he was good to her at first, but he began asking her to do things. She did not leave because she was afraid for their daughter. Nothing changed until Ilena came. He kept Ilena in the closet for the first six months unless he was torturing or raping her. She never helped Ilena because he stopped hurting her. Stabler tells her she is going to help them.Stabler informs Munch it was easy to get Dr. Morrow to flip on Morrow. When he tells Stabler and Munch she will not testify, Stabler tells him they control her now. They explain he made her too pliable making it easy for them to gain control. He tells them he controls Ilena. Stabler makes him stand up and sit back down a few times before telling him they have forced every move he has made. He denies it. When Stabler tells him they forced him to move Ilena, Morrow grins causing Stabler to go back to the squad room where Benson and Jeffries were looking over the photos. Benson confirms all of the pictures were taken in the house, but they cannot figure out one with a corner of a rug. They realize the rug was the one Constanta was wrapped in so Stabler checks Dr. Morrow's confession and finds it was taken from the bedroom. They rush out the door to find her.When they arrive in the bedroom, Benson and Stabler check under the mattress then pound around the bottom checking for a hollow sound. Stabler pulls some pieces of wood off and they remove the sheet of wood. They pull out a vented wood box and find Ilena struggling to breathe. Stabler calls for an ambulance as Benson helps her out. She begs them to tell him she did not make a sound.In Stabler's evaluation, Jackson asks how long a case like this sticks with him. He tells her a while, but he hugs his kids and kisses his wife to help him deal with it. He explains he does not want to be his families window into the world he deals with every day. When she asks if the cases involving children hits too close to home, he tells her he has seen a soulless child. He handles it by thinking about the crime, the victim, the perps, and how he could get away with killing them.Jackson informs Cragen she has seen everyone and most of what she has seen is normal. She explains the program's purpose is to identify detectives close to a meltdown. She tells him she has found some at that level and she has to recommend they be removed from duty immediately. Cragen asks, ""Who?"""

Kendal spots a woman running in the street, with a bedsheet wrapped around her, and goes after her. She tells him that she's been raped. Benson and Stabler are brought in to investigate the assault, and Kendal immediately butts heads with SVU. The rape victim (Rena West), will only trust Kendal and no one else. So Benson and Stabler must bring him in to help with the case. Kendal gives up some of the details about the perp that the victim told to him, but doesn't want to continue being on the case because it's not his concern and he doesn't like dealing with victims. Stabler appeals to Kendal's sense of justice, and Kendal agrees to help bring Rena in.At first the victim is cautious and doesn't want to have to testify at the trial, which would mean reliving the assault over and over. Stabler tells her that if the man isn't caught, he'll be free to do this over and over again to more women. Rena doesn't seem to care. Kendal manages to talk to her and gain more information about the assault. Stabler has misgivings, saying that Kendal's not used to talking to assault victims, but Cragan counters that at least Kendal is getting her talking. Benson is wary and suggests that they keep a close eye on Kendal if they're going to work with him.Since Rena was attacked after she bought groceries, the investigation moves to Domingo Deli and Grocery, where it's discovered that the surveillance camera there doesn't work. However, there's a guy in the apartment across the street who watches over everything and never forgets a face. When Benson and Stabler go to the apartment. They meet Spencer, who is autistic and takes videos of the people who come in and out of the store as a form of socializing. Benson shows him the sketch of the suspect, and Spencer pinpoints when the man was at the store. Meanwhile, Rena is shown a photo array of suspects and she points out the same man Spencer did.Facial recognition IDs the suspect as Mark Foster, who was in prison for aggravated assault for beating up his ex-wife. When Benson and Stabler go to talk to Foster, (who is working at a meat packing plant) he starts to run off. He doesn't get very far because Kendal drives up and hits Foster with his car. Once Foster is brought in, he claims that whenever a white woman is raped, a black man is brought in as the potential suspect. Foster also has an alibi. Despite his wife having a restraining order against him, he decided to visit her anyway. Stabler keeps on with the questions, but then Sonya Paxton (the new Executive ADA) says that they've gone over the amount of time allowed to question a suspect without a lawyer present. Cabot is in Albany for training and when she's done, she's going to take over Paxton's spot in Appeals.When Stabler tells Paxton that Rena was shown the photos of potential suspects in an array, Paxton says that showing the photos one at a time would be a better way to present them, since victims can only take in so many details at once. Most mis-convictions are from witness misidentifications so whatever steps they can take in order to stop putting innocent people in jail would be fine by her.The detectives go to talk to Foster's ex-wife (Layla), but find Kendal already there and physically threatening her. She's a crackhead who is unable to confirm that Foster was there when he said he was. There's a report of a case from 10 years ago with a similar MO and similar evidence, and the perp received 25 years in prison for it. It was one of Stabler's old cases, which surprises him, since if Foster was the real purp, then Stabler got an innocent man (Victor Tate) wrongly convicted. However, there is no way to connect the two cases because the evidence from 10 years ago (green fibers from the interior of a '90s van) was all used up by Forensics.Stabler goes to talk to the victim of the 10 year old case, Katie Harris. She doesn't know why she has to go through this again when she'd already told her story at the trial 10 years ago. She ID's Tate again from an array of photos. Stabler is starting to doubt that they got the right man, but Fin counters that it's not his fault. It was the entire system that failed if Tate got wrongly convicted, and the blame shouldn't rest on the shoulders of a single man.Two more alleged victims of the rapist are discovered, but since they were prostitutes, the victims gave false names and the perp was never charged. One victim is now dead, but the other has turned her life around and became a court reporter. However, she refuses to cooperate because she knows what happens in sexual assault trials and she doesn't want the same thing to happen to her.There's another case, and this time it's not just rape. The victim (Lynn Rivers) was brutally killed and mutiliated after the assault. The victim also had a cell phone with a lot of missed calls from a person named Angelina Lupino. The detectives assume that since Foster is locked up, there must be another perp, but it's discovered that Foster was let out on bail. They go to question Angelina, who says that Lynn was sent to get beer because she was the only person who had a fake ID. However, the store owner refused to sell liquor to Lynn. Warner does a post-mortem on the body and finds that the weapon was a knife with a long, tapered blade.They find that Paxton's father owns a van which matches the description of the car the perp used. The detectives also find a large amount of knives, and Paxton's father explains that he was a butcher for 40 years, so it's obvious that there would be a lot of knives in the house. When asked about the van, he says that he keeps it parked in a garage next door. Kendal notices smoke from outside, and the detectives find Foster in the middle of setting the van on fire to destroy evidence.Foster confesses to the crimes, and Stabler goes to talk to Tate, assuring the man that he'll be able to get him out of prison since the true perp of the assault has been found. Though at first doubtful that Stabler will help, eventually Tate comes around. Later, Foster is taunting Stabler, saying that he did a sloppy job and basically pointing out how he made a mistake in arresting Tate 10 years ago. Kendal offers to take Foster to the tombs, but Foster says he needs to go take a leak. Meanwhile, Rena arrives and asks to see Kendal, but Benson reminds her that Kendal doesn't work in this precinct. She also tells Rena that she can't use Kendal as a crutch forever and it would be better that she get some counseling. A crash is heard from the men's room and Kendal is found looking out of one of the windows. Below on the pavement is the body of Foster. Kendal claims that Foster jumped.Warner says that Foster's neck had been broken, but it's impossible to tell whether that happened before or after he hit the ground. Benson suspects that Kendal killed Foster, but Stabler counters that at least Foster won't be roaming the streets anymore. Paxton tells Stabler that without Foster's testimony, Tate will have to stay in prison. Stabler asks for Paxton's advice on what he can do for Tate, and Paxton says there's nothing he can do now.

Benson and Stabler are brought on the case, and the detectives have to break up the ensuing argument between the two geocachers over who found the suitcase first. Geocaching is like high-tech treasure hunting, and there are websites devoted to giving clues to where these caches are hidden. They don't think that the dead body was supposed to be the cache. When asked who put together the clues for their current hunt, the geocachers say it's someone called the Master Baiter. His website contains a video of his latest hunt, based in the subway system. His IP address is traced to a store on Staten Island called the Garb Barn.Benson and Stabler go to the store to investigate, with Benson loudly paging the ""Master Baiter"" on the store PA system. The request gets some nervous giggles from the employees but one of them takes off running with the detectives in hot pursuit. The employee says that she didn't plant the suitcase. She was only there in the tunnel to get the shot, but a train passed by once and ruined one of her takes. The video footage reveals that the suitcase was thrown off the train.The train was an express to Florida, and the victim is IDed as Emily Keefe, who had a one-way ticket to Tampa. The train's departure was delayed because of equipment problems, and it's suspected that the perp took advantage of the late train to find and kill Emily.Emily's parents are notified of their daughter's death, though her stepdad wonders why she wasn't with her dog at the time, because she never went anywhere with her dog. Emily had a wild side, hanging out with the wrong people, but then she met Owen, who was a nice guy but lost his job on Wall Street. He didn't seem to care that he was unemployed, and he spent all of his time partying and sailing. The detectives give Owen a visit, and, panicked, Owen tries to flee on an inflatable raft. Stabler shoots at the raft, stopping Owen's attempt at escape.In for questioning, Owen is told that Emily was killed. He's surprised but says right away that he didn't do it. He ran from the police because he was smoking a joint and didn't want to get caught. Drugs are found on his boat, but no evidence that Emily had been living there for awhile. Owen confesses that he's a dealer, and that he was sailing from Tampa with the drugs when Emily was found. Owen gives them the address to Emily's apartment.Benson and Stabler search the apartment, finding Emily's dog and also a number of jewelry gift boxes from Tiffanys. Her computer reveals her profile on a website called Tasty Sugar. They go to Ad-Vance United, the company behind tastysugar.com. Lizette, an assistant with the company, tells them that the website is like social networking with a romantic twist. Her boss, Vance Shepard, is told about Emily's murder, but Vance refuses to give up any of her personal information without a warrant.Emily's profile appears to have been wiped from Tasty Sugar, but the tech uses the Wayback Machine website to find a copy of her profile. Her profile also states that she can do double-dating with another girl named Pamela. Stabler posing as a client, meets Pamela, and it's learned that the Tasty Sugar website is basically a place where sugar daddies can meet potential sugar babies to spend all their money on. When Stabler asks about Emily, Pamela locks that down because Emily was stupid and fell in love with someone. Which turns out to be Vance.Vance is brought in for questioning and he's eager because he has nothing to hide. His home life is pretty much a wreck. His wife Joyce is a hypochondriac who ""faked"" having breast cancer for attention, going so far as getting a mastectomy. His daughter Chantel is starved for attention and isn't getting it from her dad. Vance says that he loved Emily and wanted to be more than her sugar daddy, but they had a fight and he ended up breaking up with Emily on the same day she was killed. Joyce tells the detectives later that she thinks Vance is immature and combative when he doesn't get his way. He was never physically abusive but was mentally abusive to her and to Chantel.Vance sticks to his story that Emily ran out of his apartment and that he stayed at home for 90 minutes before going to dinner with his assistant, Lizette. Before Vance can be questioned further, however, his lawyer (Dwight Stannich) arrives with video evidence that Emily was alive and well when she left Vance.ADA Paxton is furious that they have to release Vance, and there's a discussion about the difference between prostitution and having an actual escort service, and the difference appears to be the amount of money and gifts exchanged. Paxton suggests going to talk to Lizette the assistant again, even though the detectives say that she knows nothing. Paxton (with Benson and Stabler in tow) goes to Ad-Vance, and Paxton puts pressure on Lizette, pointing out that her impressive boob job (a gift from Vance) would make her a very grateful girl. Grateful enough to do anything that Vance told her to do. Vance arrives, upset that someone is out to harass one of his employees. Paxton points out that they're going to search through all the surveillance footage at Grand Central and eventually find Vance standing on the platform, and it's only a matter of time. Vance tells them to leave, but Paxton says she's already done her job. It wasn't Lizette she wanted to make worried; it's Vance.SVU is about to sort through hours of video from the train station when Lizette arrives and says that she can't lie for Vance any longer. She and Vance had dinner, but he arrived late, and he was out of breath and distracted. His shirt was bloody. He said that he was hit by a taxi and gave the shirt to Lizette to get dry-cleaned. Lizette still had the shirt, and she thinks that Vance killed Emily. After Lizette's confession, Vance is arrested.Vance is in interrogation and he confesses to killing Emily. He gave her everything and she still went back to an old boyfriend. Paxton realizes that Vance doesn't have his lawyer with him and tries to stop the interrogation. Vance says he doesn't need a lawyer, and he just wants to confess to the crime. Paxton just wants to do everything by the book, which means that he has to have a lawyer present even as he's saying that he killed her.At the arraignment, Vance pleads guilty but his lawyer pleads not guilty. The argument being that it was a crime of passion and Vance can't be held responsible for what he did. SVU is combing through the video footage at Grand Central and while there is evidence of Emily at the station, there's no evidence of Vance. However, there's something strange about the images of Emily, because in one shot, it doesn't look like Emily.Chantel killed Emily because she was jealous that someone around her age was spending all this time with her dad while she and her mom were basically being ignored. Vance found Emily's body and immediately decided to take the blame for her murder, because he thought that was how he could finally show Chantel that he loves her. He takes the blame for making Chantel into a cold-blooded killer. Chantel posed as Emily when getting on the train, but then the train was delayed, which made her nervous enough to dispose of the suitcase containing Emily's body. Vance asks to see his daughter one more time, and he hugs her, but she ends up stabbing him in the neck with a pair of scissors, saying that he'll never break another promise to her again. Vance bleeds to death, with Benson and Stabler in shock, and Paxton on the brink of crying."

The mirror is cracked and his hands are covered in blood. He manages to make it to his bedroom where he finds the dead body of a woman. Shocked at the scene, he throws up.Warner, Stabler, and Benson arrive at the scene to investigate. They note that the man (Dalton Rindell) has an injury on his head. The victim was bludgeoned to death. Warner notes that fluids on the victim's thighs indicate that there was sexual intercourse involved, and she can also pinpoint the exact time of death. The victim held her hands up to protect herself from the blows, and her watch on her wrist was broken at 12:57. There is an engraving on the watch which reads ""Audrey, with eternal love, Michael."" Benson suggests that Rindell was having an affair with Audrey, and that Michael found out about it and attacked the pair of lovers while they were in bed.Rindell doesn't remember what happened, he must have blacked out between the victim's time of death and the next morning when he called 911. The paramedic claims that the injury on Rindell's head shouldn't affect his memory, but Rindell remembers nothing about last night. He doesn't know who the woman is, and thinks that he was attacked himself. Stabler is skeptical of Rindell's story, as there were no signs of forced entry. However, there is also no evidence of the victim's purse. They decide to get a DNA sample from Rindell.Rindell is at the station being fingerprinted, and he keeps wondering about why he would be targetted for something like this. Munch gives him a release to sign so that they'll be able to search his apartment without a warrant, and he signs it without complaint. Warner takes a DNA sample from Rindell, and Benson arrives with a toolbox found in Rindell's apartment. The hammer is missing. Rindell claims to feel very very sick, and Stabler says they should take him to the hospital.The doctor finds a sliver of glass embedded in Rindell's head but otherwise his CT scan is normal. He is dehydrated, however, so was Rindell drinking heavily the previous night? Rindell denies it, he doesn't drink or take drugs. And all he remembers from last night was that he was working. Munch and Fin meanwhile go through the man's apartment. They find that his bathroom is lined with bloody handprints and used towels, and when they check the shower itself, they find a hammer, which has been cleaned of blood and prints.Rindell still doesn't remember a thing, and still insists that he was working that night. He is a building developer and was at a gathering of people he and his partner had presold condo units to. Construction on the building had to stop because the crew found a problem, so the developers had a get-together to help ease buyers' concerns. Did Rindell drink then? Rindell, again, denies it.Cragen goes to the development company to talk to Rindell's partner Bill Tattinger. Cragen wonders whether the developers might be just taking the buyers' money without giving them an actual return. Tattinger counters that the company just needs another round of financing to help cover the costs, and that the building will become a landmark. Otherwise, the company will have to file bankruptcy. Cragen figures that this could be motive enough for murder and asks for a list of their buyers. Tattinger doesn't give up the names. Meanwhile, Munch and Fin discover that the victim's bag was tossed out of Rindell's apartment last night. Inside, they find the victim's personal effects, including a purse. She's IDed as Audrey Hale, a doctor at a women's clinic.Benson and Stabler are questioning Audrey's ex-husband. He claims to have been worried about her job at the clinic, since they do abortions there and their family had been threatened before. During the divorce hearing, he petitioned for sole custody of their daughter, but he lost. He'd always assumed that Audrey would eventually get hurt because of her job. He doesn't seem to have any connection to Rindell or to the development company.Rindell still believes that he was being set up, even when confronted about the abortion issue by Munch. So Benson and Stabler go to the women's clinic, and confront a protester, who says that Audrey's death was a blessing because now there was one less mass murderer out there. Inside the clinic, the detectives speak to Dr. Kittle, who shows them a box of hate mail that the clinic has received. Benson takes the letters. The detectives find out from Dr. Kittle that Audrey had plans for dinner with a female friend last night.They speak to Audrey's friend, Linda, who says that they had dinner and shared a taxi home, but then went to a bar for a nightcap. At the bar, Audrey met a guy who matched Rindell's description, and they were getting along so well that Linda decided to go home without Audrey.The detectives are driving Rindell home and they pass by the bar, but he claims that he doesn't remember the place. He's been sober for over a year and shows Stabler his 1 year sobriety chip. However, when they go inside, the bartender remembers seeing him there last night with Audrey. Rindell says he's going to vomit so he rushes to the men's room. Stabler tries to follow him inside, but he's too late to slip in before Rindell shuts the door. Stabler receives a phone call, so he has to move away from the bathroom to get better reception. The DNA evidence on Audrey matches Rindell. When Stabler goes back to the bathroom, he finds Rindell has fled.Cragen chastises the detectives for bringing Rindell on a field trip. There seems to be no action on his credit cards or his bank accounts. They're keeping an eye on the garage where he keeps his car, and the airport, train, and bus terminals have all been alerted. ADA Paxton arrives and complains about her missing defendant. She now has to go through a separate hearing since Stabler screwed up on the bartender's ID of Rindell.Paxton and Cragen study a computer-generated recreation of the crime scene. The victim apparently was in bed, and Rindell attacks her with the hammer, which causes her to fall out of the bed. Rindell then continues to bludgeon her on the floor. Cragen mentions that the sex has to be consensual because they were both at a bar and drinking heavily, but Paxton doesn't think that being drunk is an excuse for obvious rape. The severity of the blows suggests that Rindell should be covered in blood, but no bloody clothes were found. So the tech wonders if Rindell was naked when he did the crime. He must have cleaned up a little and then smashed his head in the mirror after he found out what he had really done. Cragen receives Rindell's phone records. He called Tattinger many times but those calls went unanswered, however, he did manage to call his ex.Rindell's ex-wife has no idea where he is, and when Munch tells her about the phone call, she tells them about the strange story he told her, about how he was being set up. But as a rental agent, she'd have a lot of places where Rindell could hide. She claims that she doesn't want anything to do with him anymore, since she managed to quit drinking and he didn't. He became a different man when he was drunk, and she left because of that. She says that Tattinger might be the one who'd give him help.Benson and Stabler arrive at the development company, and discover Rindell and Tattinger fighting. Rindell is cuffed and demands that Tattinger tell the detectives the truth of what happened. Tattinger admits that he slipped Rindell a little alcohol at the gathering, because he still needed to convince the buyers that their investment was safe.Rindell admits that he's on anxiety medication, which you're not supposed to mix with alcohol. He thinks that Tattinger must have made his drink really strong because he doesn't remember having that many drinks, doesn't remember leaving the office, and doesn't remember what happened afterwards.Paxton thinks that Rindell is using alcohol as a crutch, and that alcoholism isn't actually a disease because one can stop whenever one wishes. Cragen counters that alcoholism is a recognized addiction, and that he's been sober for over 20 years. He still has to fight with the addiction every day. Paxton says that alcoholism shouldn't be an excuse for rape and murder. Cragen adds that they can pin Rindell on the murder but not on the rape. A woman arrives at the station, who claims to have worked at the development company for awhile. Rindell sexually harassed her by exposing himself and then grabbing at her.Rindell says that that was the last time he'd taken a drop of alcohol until Tattinger made him drink again, but Paxton still insists that he shouldn't give alcohol as an excuse. She claims that Rindell found out what Audrey did and killed her in a blind rage, but Rindell keeps saying that he's not anti-abortion. He just doesn't remember what happened, and he has had alcohol-induced blackouts before. Paxton shows him a computer screen which plays the recreation of the murder, but Rindell's face has been placed on the assailant's face.At a Frye hearing, Dr. Sofer is giving testimony on the problem of alcoholism and how much a person's judgment is impaired because of it. Paxton doesn't think the hearing is necessary and objects to the hearing, even though new scientific evidence might be brought in to her case. Addiction is a disease, and people who are prone to addiction have physical changes to various segments of the brain. Even if Rindell took a drink on his own, his addiction to alcohol made it impossible for him to keep any self-control.Paxton cross-examines Sofer, to get her to agree that not all addicts commit murder. Alcoholism isn't a disease like a tumor. A tumor can't be cured just by thinking about not having the cancer, but people can force themselves to stop drinking. Paxton manages to convince the judge that the ""alcoholism as a disease"" defense won't be admissible in court. Benson admits that her mother was a drunk, and she died falling down a flight of stairs. The question of alcoholism as addiction isn't so cut and dry, but if there were a cure for it, then her mother would still be alive. Rindell is now claiming temporary insanity for alcohol psychosis.At the hearing, Paxton shows the computer recreation of the murder, but it's the wrong file. It's the one with Rindell's face on the assailant, which has tainted the jury since it clearly places Rindell at the scene of the crime. Later Paxton is at a bar, drinking, as Benson and Stabler enter. The judge sent the jury home, and the detectives try to console Paxton. But she's having none of it. If the judge polls the jury and finds that they can't disregard the computer simulation, he will be forced to let Rindell go and declare a mistrial. Paxton says she'll need the entire night to prepare for the next day in court.In court the next day, Paxton is late and harried-looking. Rindell immediately pegs her as being drunk. Benson ends up giving her a sobriety test, and her blood alcohol level is just above the legal limit. The judge tells her she should be removed from the courtroom, and Benson tries to escort her out.A mistrial has been called on the case, and Benson tells Rindell that he's an extremely lucky man. Rindell counters that no matter what, this case will be haunting him for the rest of his life. He confesses that he realizes that he'd killed Audrey and starts to break down. He was so drunk that he doesn't think a memory of the event formed in his head. The stress from his business probably made him snap, and now that he realizes what he's done, he can't let go of it.The detectives discuss Paxton's dismissal and Stabler points out that this was why she was such a control freak, that she was a functioning alcoholic trying to control everything she could. Paxton is off to court-ordered rehab and apologizes to the detectives before she leaves. Later, Benson goes to visit her mother's grave, placing a bouquet of roses on her tombstone."

Both victims' throats have been sliced through, and the woman's breasts have been surgically removed. Her underwear is found hanging on a clothesline, and Benson wonders if she has been raped. Later, as Munch and Cragan discuss the case, Munch watches as new phone lines are installed at the precinct, an update which Cragan had spent over a decade applying for.Warner finds out that the murder weapon is a scalpel. A tattoo on the male victim points to him possibly being involved in a Mexican drug cartel. Cragan gets Munch to send pictures of the tattoo and the male victims' fingerprints to the FBI to see if he'd border-crossed legally. But because of the victims' teeth, Warner thinks that they must be American. They have no other clues to help them apart from some unidentifiable brown fibers.The detectives track down the male victim's identity through the car rental company. His name was Carlos Martinez and he left a Mercedes behind at the car rental lot. Checking the GPS in the car, the detectives trace the last place Martinez planned on going. The address is an abandoned residence which could have been used as a drug factory. They also find evidence that Ramona Rodriguez, the female victim, attempted to destroy her license by setting it on fire.Benson and Stabler track down Ramona's roommate, Terri, and she claims that she did not know Ramona very well. She just needed the money Ramona's rent brought in. Ramona's passport shows that she'd been traveling all over the place, as a drug mule. Maybe her breast implants were usually filled with heroin. They also find the source for the mysterious brown fibers, from a teddy bear on Ramona's bed. Meanwhile, someone else is trying to visit Terri's apartment: Agent Dean Porter.Porter explains that the teddy bear contains a half kilo of black tar heroin, and the detectives inform him that Martinez and Ramona are dead. Martinez, Porter says, was about to hit the FBI 10 most wanted list and he thinks the victims were attacked by a rival drug cartel because of how the victims were found. Cragan makes a deal with Porter: the FBI tracks down the drugs, and SVU tackles the homicides.Benson and Porter share small talk for a while and then Stabler puts a stop to their conversation. A search warrant is obtained and the detectives go through Ramona's apartment, discovering a safe deposit box key. The box (belonging to a man named Juan Pablo) contains a plane ticket. Timmons wants to try and get the real owner of the box from the prints on it. A flight coming in from Mexico might just have their suspect aboard.The detectives go to JFK airport, where Stabler spots a Hispanic male with a shipment of kid's toys. Cragan informs Benson that Pablo's real name is Manuel Rojas. Porter is at the airport and chases after the van that took the shipment of toys. However, Stabler sees that Rojas hasn't left the airport yet. Benson goes after Rojas but she is taken hostage by him instead.A cop is shot by Rojas as he continues to drag Benson around with him. Stabler goes after them, but when Rojas puts the gun to Benson's head, Stabler refuses to negotiate. When Benson accuses Rojas of killing Ramona and Martinez, he denies it. Rojas is shockingly shot dead by Porter. But Porter was supposed to be going after the drugs, not the murder suspect. Porter mentions that the FBI was in contact with an informant who said that Ramona and Martinez were planning to double-cross and steal from their gang, and so Rojas killed them. Cragan declares that SVU's role in the case is over and that Benson and Stabler should start putting together their report.The detectives work through the report when Warner discovers that a third DNA profile was at the crime scene, not from Rojas but from a woman. There's no evidence that Rojas ever set foot in the rental. Therefore, Benson concludes that the DNA must belong to Terri, the roommate. She wants to call Porter to tell him about this discover, but Stabler stops her.The detectives go to Terri's apartment, and Stable recognizes a cable television installer as the same man who worked on the phone line updates at the precinct. Morales searches through SVU to find all the bugs, and the cable technician, Michael Garcia, is brought in for questioning. Porter is there too but when he tells Garcia that he could face up to 30 years in prison, Garcia doesn't say a word. Porter wonders if rogue cops recruited Garcia to keep SVU off the trail of the drugs. Porter wants to handle the rest of the case, but Stabler wants SVU to do it. Porter claims that the two detectives are in for way more than they bargained for, since the cartels have bugged the precinct phones.Stabler decides to go against orders and the detectives continue to track Terri. In a grocery store, Benson spots Terri putting a bag in a shopping cart and then takes the cart of another man. Terri flees before Benson can stop her, but Benson manages to grab the man with the exchanged cart. The bag contains Ramona's breast implant. With Porter keeping an eye on things from a distance, the detectives arrest the man. The man denies that the bag is his.The implant contains a SIM card with coded data, containing a list of names and addresses. However, before the detectives try to track down those names, Porter comes in with a warrant from federal court, giving the FBI all evidence in the murder case. Morales figures out that it was the FBI that bugged SVU, and that Benson and Stabler are constantly being watched. Garcia must have also been working for Porter as well.Porter was well aware that Terri murdered Ramona and Martinez. Terri is a CIA spook, and Munch theorizes that Terri was gathering intelligence on the SVU for Cuba. The SIM card contains a list of names of American agents that Terri wanted to rat out. Ramona and Terri were close friends in high school, and Porter watched the detectives to keep them from uncovering Terri's true motives.Benson banks on her shared history with Porter to get some information out of him. He comes to her apartment with a bouquet of flowers. Morales and Stabler access Porter's phone while Benson kisses Porter to divert his attention. After the information is downloaded, Cragen calls Benson and claims that they found Terri. Porter takes off, and the detectives track Porter as he tries to get to Terri first.Benson and Stabler find Terri and arrest her for murder. They bring her into SVU, where she claims that the names on the card are for the resistance in Cuba, so that they knew who to send their gathered information to in the US. Terri says that she had no idea Ramona was a mule, but once Ramona got the breast implants, she blackmailed Terri for money to keep her quiet. Afraid that she was going to sell off the information on the card, Terri had to kill Ramona, take the breast implants, and kill Martinez to alleviate any witnesses. And Porter was aware of everything from the start.Benson wants to arrest Porter, but Cragen receives an order from higher up saying that they need to let Terri and Porter go. After Porter claims that this was all due to the heightened national security, Benson wonders why he didn't tell her everything considering the history they had together.

Meanwhile outside the motel, a boy shoots up. The girl is joined by a mysterious man, who proceeds to choke her to death. The boy leaves the scene in his car before the police arrive. Benson and Stabler talk to the desk clerk, who claims that the girl paid in cash and came to the motel alone, but she was expecting someone else to join her. The room was in the name ""A.J. Gold.""Warner sees that the victim was raped, sodomized, and then strangled. The victim can't have been a prostitute because she doesn't look like one, and also she seems to have struggled against her killer. There is evidence of blood in her mouth which is not hers. Fin says that pics of the murder victim have been leaked onto the Internet, and those photos were not police photos. They were taken hours before the police arrived. The desk clerk confesses that he took the photos and sold them to a website. He also says that he didn't kill her. He was alerted to the scene after another guest complained that they heard screaming coming from A.J.'s room. The desk clerk also stole A.J.'s cell phone. When the detectives point out a really bad cut in the clerk's arm, the clerk says that he got it from cooking heroin.Using the cell phone, the detectives get in touch with two of A.J.'s friends. They speak to the girls, and they say that A.J. was looking for an older man to have sex with. However, she wasn't a prostitute. A.J. also told them that her father molested her. This leads the detectives to talk to A.J.'s parents. Terri, her mother, didn't realize that A.J. was going around saying that Greg (her father) molested her. A.J. and her dad didn't have a good relationship, however, and they were always arguing. In fact, there was a huge blow up between them right before A.J. died. Greg arrives at the Dunne home, and his shirt is stained with blood. The detectives immediately arrest him for the rape and murder of his daughter.In Interrogation, Greg claims that he did not kill his daughter. Terri says that A.J. was put in a youth treatment facility called A Sheltered Place for her oppositional defiant disorder. A Sheltered Place (ASP) is run by a man named Martin Gold. Terri fully believes that Gold had the ability to help her daughter, but Greg says that Gold lies in order to keep his facility running. Gold had told A.J. that she was troubled because her father molested her, and A.J. was starting to believe it. Someone left a flyer on the windshield of Greg's car with a picture of Gold and A.J., and the text at the bottom read: ""Martin Gold is raping your daughter"". Greg went to confront Gold about this and they got into a fight, where Gold stabbed Greg with a pen. Greg was arrested, and had just returned from jail to the news that his daughter is dead. Greg thinks that Gold killed A.J.The detectives go to ASP to speak with Gold, and they arrive in the middle of one of Gold's speeches to the teens. The teens leave, and they all tell Gold that they love him. Gold says he doesn't want to press charges against Greg. Stabler gives Gold the flyer from Greg's car, and Gold claims that the picture was faked. He has an alibi for the time of A.J.'s murder: he was at the shelter and he has the survelliance tapes to prove it. But when the detectives ask for the tapes, Gold says no. He claims not to know why A.J. signed for a room with ""A.J. Gold"".Cabot, angry that the detectives weren't able to get at the tapes, issues a warrant so that they can confiscate them. But when they go over the tapes, they see that Gold was telling the truth. ASP's website is fairly popular, and their motto is ""We diminish the power of unwanted thought and impulses by embracing them."" Stabler and Benson are very concerned about Gold's methods, but Cragen argues that Gold's success rate is 83%. The detectives also have to be careful around the facility because the daughter of Deputy Mayor for Legal Affairs is currently a patient of Gold's.Morales figures out that the picture of Gold and A.J. was Photoshopped. But from the tapes, he also discovers that A.J. was staying overnight at ASP, and Gold's facility isn't legally set up as a live-in shelter. The detectives speak to A.J.'s parents and they say that they let their daughter stay at the facility because Gold claimed it would be easier to help her.Munch finds out that A.J.'s credit card was just used in Little Italy. Warner notices that the blood in A.J.'s mouth contains trances of drugs used to treat Hepatitis C. The detectives aim to talk to the desk clerk at the motel again but then they see a boy in the morgue, near A.J.'s body. The boy, Enzo, tries to run away but is caught. Fin tracks down and arrests the suspect who used the credit card, Ramsey Vickers. Enzo thinks that A.J.'s death was his fault. Meanwhile, Vickers is extremely nervous and wants to talk to a lawyer first. But when Cragen comes in, Vickers suddenly collapses and is taken to the hospital.Vickers is suffering serious side effects because of a bite on his penis. A.J. apparently bit down on him as he molested her, which means that he's the one who killed her. He says that he didn't intend to kill A.J., and that he met her through a Craigslist ad.The detectives bring up A.J.'s ad, which states that she's looking for an older man whom she could pretend to be her father as she slept with him. Enzo is also one of Gold's patients, and he was at ASP to be treated for heroin addiction. He met A.J. and they fell in love. However, they had to keep their relationship a secret because Gold forbids patients to date each other. Enzo was the one who Photoshopped the picture, but he knew for sure that Gold was raping A.J. to help her get over her fears. On the day A.J. was killed, Enzo had followed her to the hotel room, but he chickened out and ran away so he wasn't able to help her. Stabler asks if Enzo would agree to testify in court against Gold, and Enzo says yes.Huang believes that Enzo would be more beneficial to their case if he has the heroin out of his system, and he also believes that Gold is taking advantage of troubled teenagers in order to entertain himself. Benson and Stabler arrest Gold right in the middle of a therapy session, but during interrogation, Gold is confident that the jury won't believe Enzo's testimony.The detectives ask Cabot to press charges against Gold, but Cabot hesitates, since the only testimony they'd have is from a drug addict. Huang tells the detectives about a new type of medication which can cure heroin addiction in 24 hours. If they got Enzo this treatment, then he could testify clean. The drug hasn't been approved yet in the US, however. The police have to let Gold go, and since he has legal custody of Enzo, he takes the boy too. Benson and Stabler suspect that Gold is supplying Enzo with drugs so that he wouldn't be able to take the stand.Huang finds Gold's file on Enzo and then takes the boy from the shelter. Benson tells him that what he's doing is illegal, but Huang doesn't think he has a choice. He brings Enzo to get the drug, after convincing the boy that this is the only way that he'll get better. Later at ASP, Enzo asks Gold to forgive him for what he did with Huang. Enzo asks Gold for more drugs and Gold willingly hands out some to him. The detectives then arrest Gold for drug possession and distribution and as an accessory to murder.Enzo, now free of the addiction, is fine to take the stand. Huang turns himself in for his law-breaking, and he gets his medical license suspended for 30 days, which he thinks is a very small price to pay."

The victim is Dickie's classmate and he says that she had photos on the Internet where she's baring her chest for the camera. Dickie's friend Shane, an ex-drug addict whom Stabler doesn't trust, drops by so that he and Dickie can go to school together.At the trial, defendant Sam Baylor's attorney says that the prosecution is keeping a recant statement from Nikki hidden from the defense, and that the defense has a witness which will prove that what happened to Nikki was consensual. Cabot doesn't think that the defense has anyone. A representative from the state bar (Liam Black) comes into the courtroom. The detectives give testimony that they handed all available evidence to Cabot. However, the judge offers 48 hours to Cabot to get their side of the story straight.Cabot and Black talk, and Cabot wonders whether the investigation into the way she practices is because of what happened to Sonya Paxton. SVU is on the spot, and if Cabot's license to practice is revoked, then the detectives are going to be targeted next for review. More bad news comes from Cragen, who tells Stabler that his son is missing. Stabler learns from Kathy that Dickie fought with another boy before he took off. Stabler assumes that he's with Shane. Gomez tells Stabler that she can help, but Stabler doesn't want to file a missing person's report just yet. However, Kathy does, and Gomez starts to check the cellphone towers to track Dickie down via phone call.Stabler receives a phone call from the bank, which mentions that Dickie tried to use an emergency credit card at an ATM. Kathy tries to find their son while Stabler goes to Shane's mother Belinda. She says that Shane has been clean for months, but Stabler isn't sure and doesn't like the fact that Shane and Dickie are friends. Belinda is frustrated with Stabler's suspicions and tells him that his son would rather be called ""Richard"" than Dickie. Later, the bank calls Stabler again, alerting him that Dickie's emergency credit card was being used again. Cragen says that there's another more pressing case that Stabler needs to focus on.Stabler, along with Fin and Benson, go over the evidence for the Sherman case. The victim says that Sam forced himself on her at a party and physical evidence shows that she had Sam's DNA on her and that there was some evidence of rape. But Sam says the sex was consensual and there was evidence of rape only because Nikki was a virgin. The defense claims to have evidence that Nikki said she wished to have sex with Sam. After thinking that they gave up all the evidence they could to the defense, Stabler remembers the online picture of Nikki which Dickie told him about.Kathy arrives at the precinct, very troubled about what's happened to Dickie. She says he called her and he sounded panicky. He wanted the code to the emergency card and he lost Shane. He called from a dangerous neighborhood in the south Bronx, and Fin heads off to check the surveillance footage from the ATM. The detectives are told by Cragen that they can continue working on finding Dickie until they get a break in the Sherman case. Benson and Stabler interrogate Danny Proctor, the boy Dickie fought with earlier. Dickie was trying to defend Shane because Shane had sold Danny a few stolen items to pay to get into the Army. A recruiter had been speaking to Shane and Dickie.Stabler confronts the Army recruiter, Sgt. Jordan, asking why he's targeting a minor. Dickie should be kicked out of the recruitment office the next time he enters it, but the Army needs soldiers and Jordan makes no promises to Stabler about turning Dickie away. And once Dickie turns 18, his dad won't have any power over this anymore.The ATM surveillance footage shows Shane with Dickie's card, but Dickie isn't around. Stabler lays out plans to find his son, but Munch has discovered new evidence in the Sherman case, her topless photo. The picture shows her surrounded by high school boys, including Sam. Furious, Cabot wonders why they hadn't gotten this picture earlier and blames Stabler's preoccupation with finding his son. Cabot explains that their every move is being scrutinized by the state bar, but Stabler doesn't back down.Fin and Benson speak to Belinda, who tells them that Shane was constantly getting calls from Dickie. When the detectives suggest that Shane has fallen off the wagon, Belinda once again insists that her son is clean. Shane donates some of his spare time at the homeless shelter because that is where his sponsor works. Belinda accuses the detectives of just wanting to arrest Shane and refuses to give them permission to check his phone. Stabler thinks that Shane was forcing Dickie to get cash for him, but its unclear whether Shane was going to use the money for drugs or for something else.The last number called on Shane's phone was at the homeless shelter, and the detectives go to talk to Shane's sponsor, Carrie. She says that the last time she spoke with Shane, he was clean and that Shane was growing close to a homeless man named Harold, who was still a drug addict. Dickie had also come in asking about Harold. When Stabler arrives, they find Dickie bludgeoning Harold with a piece of wood.Cabot and Nikki talk about the photo. Nikki claims that somebody put something in her drink, and Cabot suggests that Nikki was slipped the date rape drug. But the party happened three weeks before the rape, and the only reason she was there was because she wanted to hang out with the seniors. Cabot says that Nikki has to tell her father about the photo.Dickie tells Benson that Shane needed money to buy a fake ID and birth certificate so that he could join the Army. Also he knows that Shane is clean. He then asks Benson if she's ever slept with her partner. Harold knows where Shane is and Dickie just wanted to find out. Shane's phone is traced to central booking, but the boy himself isn't there and Shane's phone has blood on it. Dickie learns that Shane is missing and that they have to find him right away. Stabler tells Dickie that since he's his father, he has a right to know where Dickie is at all times. But Dickie doesn't want to be controlled by his father any more. Livid, Stabler then shoves Dickie against the wall.It's Shane's blood on his phone, and the phone was stolen by a man named Neal Douglas, who has a long criminal record. The detectives start to speak to Neal but Cabot intervenes, saying that Neal is required to have his lawyer present before the interrogation can continue. Later, Paxton warns Cabot that she can't give more ammo to the state bar.Cabot has dropped the charges against Sam Baylor, which upsets Nikki. She should have listened to her friends and not said anything. Munch is put in charge of SVU because Cragen was allowing Stabler too much leeway in investigating his own case. Cragen informs Stabler that they just found Shane's body in a dumpster. Cabot berates Stabler for going to the crime scene, and Benson tells Cabot that she just requested a new ADA since Cabot just dumped a rape victim to save her own career.Shane has multiple stab wounds and was stomped and kicked to death. His death would have been very slow and very torturous. The tox screens on his body show that he was completely clean of drugs. Stabler listens to Warner's report, feeling guilty for accusing Shane of being a bad influence on Dickie. Neal, the suspect in Shane's murder, was given the phone in a swap for drugs, but he didn't know whom he gave the drugs to. However, he was a homeless man. Fin goes to nab Howard, who assaults Fin with a knife. Harold, severely mentally disturbed, had killed Shane just to get his phone and to get his drugs.Stabler studies more tape footage, thinking that he could have helped Shane if he had managed to look at the tapes in time. Benson goes to talk to Nikki, but finds her passed out on her bed with an empty bottle of Oxycontin nearby. Benson tries to revive Nikki using CPR. Meanwhile, Stabler's attempt to talk to Belinda falls on deaf ears. Cabot is trying to refile for the Sherman case, and brings in Nikki's friend Amy. Amy had lied in her testimony when she said that Sam had invited Nikki to parties. Amy was bribed to lie, and she's now willing to share the truth.Dickie has been out all night before coming home. He tells his dad that Belinda won't talk to him and won't let him attend Shane's funeral. Stabler feels guilty, but when Dickie offers him the Army consent form, Stabler refuses to put his signature on it. Dickie begins to cry and Stabler gives him a fierce hug."

The man (Clyde) had his male parts cut off, and Warner notes to Stabler that the man was tasered. Fin checks the victim's pockets and discovers one of Benson's business cards inside. Meanwhile, Benson is out sick with the flu. Stabler goes to see her about the victim, but she doesn't remember ever meeting the man, and neither does Stabler. Stabler informs Benson that he's going to take care of the case.Fin and Munch visit the headquarters of the Death Knights, Clyde's motorcycle club. The detectives try to talk to the bikers but the club doesn't want the cops involved. When a club member shows up without the right license to operate a bike, however, the detectives force him to cooperate. They bring the biker to the precinct and make him watch survellience footage of a gang rape of a girl (Starla) which the biker participated in. The biker denies that it was rape, saying that she consented to it. The night that Clyde was freed from Attica prison, Starla was given to him as a gift from his club. Starla eventually became Clyde's old lady. Cragen says that Starla's story better match, else the biker will be arrested for rape.Stabler drops by Starla's home but she isn't there. Right before he leaves, however, he spots her, carrying a briefcase and dressed in a business suit. She panics at the sight of the detective and tries to run, but her suitcase flies open, and a lot of government documents tumble out. Starla claims that she didn't murder Clyde, and that the footage with her and the Death Knights wasn't gang rape. Starla has a job at the city clerk's office, but she's been pilfering blank birth certificates. She willingly admits that she wants to become a part of the Death Knights and has no shame for what she's done. She claims to not know Benson either.Cragen discovers that a 911 call was placed concerning Clyde's bike. A dark haired woman in a black Mustang was spotted hitting the motorcycle, but the caller only remembered part of the license plate. When the numbers are run, however, Benson's name pops up as a possible owner of the vehicle. Cragen goes with Benson to examine her car. She says that she's been home sick and hasn't driven her car in almost a moth. However, the damage to the car (a broken headlight and a large dent) tell a different story.The detectives all believe that Benson didn't cause the accident, and Fin says he'll try to find the person who placed the 911 call. To stave off any suspicion, Benson asks Warner to take a swab of her DNA. Fin and Munch do find the person who made the call. Khalil has a thick accent which doesn't match the voice of the caller on the tape. He says that he let someone borrow his cell phone to call 911 about a car accident. Khalil offers the detectives a description of the man, but it's too vague to be of much use. Meanwhile, the attempt to get survellience footage from Benson's garage hits a snag because the garage cycles through their tapes every 24 hours and that window has already passed. No one will be able to tell who took Benson's car. Benson is at the precinct, searching through her old case files to try and figure out her connection to the current case. Cragen tells her to go home and get some rest, and that Stabler will search through their cases.As he tracks down the Death Knights, Stabler informs Kathy on his cell that he's working late. But then he spots a biker pouring beer all over his car. It turns out the biker is an undercover cop, Russell, who has infiltrated the gang. Russell explains that his partner is working survelliance in a nearby building and that Stabler should check things out there. Russell's partner, Detective Lewis, has been tracking the Death Knights for the past six months. Lewis informs Stabler that Clyde seemed pretty close to all of the other gang members, and no one would have had any reason to try to kill him. Stabler brings up Benson to Lewis, and Lewis admits that he dug around once Benson's name came up, just in case she had any ties to the gang. But she's clean. Lewis also shows Stabler a photo of a man who is working on Clyde's bike, installing a GPS tracking device.Lieutenant Tucker wakes Benson from sleep, and ends up arresting her for murder even after she vehemently denies doing the deed. At the precinct, Benson gives Tucker her story. She was home sick with the flu, but she doesn't have an alibi. Tucker thinks that the fact that no one checked in on her is suspicious. Stabler finds out from Cragen that Benson gave up her Miranda rights, which might not be the best thing, even when she's proclaiming her innocence. Stabler tells Cragen about the photo. If they find the man in that photo, that would help clear Benson's name. Cragen suggests releasing the photo to the media and let the public help find him. Meanwhile Tucker accuses Benson of being dirty, which means that her partner Stabler is probably dirty as well.Tucker reminds Benson that she was getting psychiatric care last year and that she might have PTSD, cracked under the pressure and killed Clyde. Benson pleads for Tucker to tell her what evidence they have to link her to the crime. And Tucker says that her blood was found on the murder weapon. Benson finally realizes that she needs a lawyer. Stabler goes ballistic at Warner for tainting the evidence, but Warner is certain that Benson's DNA was on the knife that killed Clyde.In Central Booking, Benson discovers that her attorney will be Trevor Langan, who says that her friends paid for his assignment so she can't balk at who she got as a lawyer. Members of the Death Knights are at Benson's arraignment. Her bail is set and Langan says he has to get her out of Riker's Island before any other Death Knights get a hold of her. Benson posts bail thanks to Stabler, who took a mortgage out on his house. A tip from an ex-girlfriend leads the detectives to Lawrence Grabowski, who is stuck underneath a shelf in his office. The gang might have gotten to him first. Lawrence claims that he did not do anything to Clyde and that he didn't take Benson's blood. He was only following Benson because he was hired by someone else, Brady Harrison. Harrison was convicted of a series of date rapes and was sent to prison thanks to Benson and Stabler.Munch and Cragen finally discover the link between Harrison and Clyde. They were in Attica together, and apparently got into a fight, where Harrison was so badly beat up that he had to be taken to the infirmary. Fin and Stabler go to Harrison's place, but they don't find him. They also find that the place has already been turned upside down, presumably by the Death Knights. Stabler tracks down the gang, and Russell says that the club did go to Harrison's home, but he was already gone. Without Harrison, Benson will be the one tried for Clyde's murder.Benson returns to her home as the detectives try to find Harrison. Harrison hired Lawrence to follow Benson into a restaurant, and Lawrence took Benson's eating utensils after she was done with them. However, Warner says that the sample she tested had Benson's blood, not her saliva. The detectives find out that there is now a way to combine blood with any DNA to create a faked DNA sample.  The detectives go to talk to Dr. Joseph, who has a reputation for making these fabricated blood samples. Dr. Joseph knows Harrison and Fin tells the doctor to get in touch with him. They track down Harrison's location, and he isn't that far from Benson's apartment.Harrison breaks into Benson's home, grabs her and threatens her with his Taser. He's convinced that Benson planned for Clyde to rape him in prison because she told him ""that's what happens to 'pretty boys' in there. 'You'll understand what you put those women through.'"" Benson apologizes and she tells Harrison that she wasn't aware he was going to be sexually assaulted. Harrison is ready to shoot himself in the head since he's the only person who knows the entire truth. Olivia throws a lamp and herself at him so he can't commit suicide. They struggle, and Olivia grabs his Taser and uses it on Harrison. Then Stabler arrives and arrests him. Back at the precinct, Stabler and Benson speak to Dr. Joseph about the fabricated DNA. The DNA may have put a lot of innocent people in prison as well as let a lot of true criminals go free. Now that even DNA isn't 100% rock solid proof, this changes the way the detectives go after evidence."

The body of a young woman has been found. Her ID says that she's 23 but Benson thinks she looks much younger than that. The victim had apparently been sexually assaulted. Neighbors say that the did hear the screaming but no one decided to help. The ID is found to be a fake, and from a list of missing persons, Fin is able to figure out the identity of the victim, Anna McWilliams, age 17. Anna's father positively identifies the body and explains that Anna seemed to have gone through a change since her mother died of cancer. She did have a boyfriend, Henry, whom she broke up with after her mom's death.The detectives head to Anna's high school in order to question Henry, who states that he was with Anna that night, but she got a text message on her phone from a website called Anonymous Quickie, which matches up strangers for one-night stands. Anna left Henry in order to go to that hook-up. From the website, the team finds out who Anna was meant to meet that night: a man named Peter. He is arrested for the rape and murder of Anna McWilliams.The team also finds out that Peter knew a woman named Rebecca, who was raped and whom SVU interviewed. Benson goes to talk to Rebecca, who says she did sleep with Peter a long time ago, but he was rough with her. A DNA test said that Peter was not responsible for her rape, however, nor was he responsible for Anna's, and he is released. Later, the detectives talk to Henry again and he says that he killed Anna.Warner tells the team that Anna was HIV positive at the time of her death, and that Peter is as well. The detectives think that Peter has been having unprotective sex with many women during his one-night stands. Peter confesses that their suspicions are correct. Later, Benson and Cabot go to talk to Rebecca, who confirms that she also has HIV, and now suspects that it was Peter who infected her. Cabot tells Rebecca that she should testify at Peter's trial, in order to stop him from spreading the virus to more women. Rebecca agrees.Benson then speaks to Peter, wanting to get to the bottom of why he wants to have so many one-night stands. She thinks it might have something to do with his mother. Peter becomes agitated at mention of his mother and says that the only person who ever cared about him was his grandfather.At the trial, Rebecca suddenly rushes toward Peter and sprays hydrochloric acid on his face. Peter's attorney informs Cabot that he wants to sue the DA office for negligence in failing to keep his client safe. He's pressed charges against Rebecca and if they drop the charges against Peter, he'll drop his against Rebecca. Cabot tells Rebecca that she should take the plea bargain but she doesn't want to. Therefore, Rebecca's case moves forward.At Rebecca's trial, she confesses that she was completely aware that she should not have had unprotected sex with a stranger, especially since a safe sex billboard can be seen outside her apartment. Peter's grandfather, Dewey, speaks to Cabot and he says that he wants to speak in Rebecca's defense during the trial. Cabot tells him that he can't testify because there's no evidence that he's linked to the case in any way. He tells her that he's the one who warned Rebecca and all of Peter's other partners.The detectives decide to speak to Dewey again, though Peter opens the door and says that his grandfather doesn't wish to talk to them. Stabler and Benson tell Peter that it was Dewey who logged into his FaceUnion page and told all his partners that he had HIV. Peter confronts Dewey, and Dewey tells him the truth about his mother. She was sent to prison for killing her abusive boyfriend and she died there. Dewey thought that telling the truth to Peter would be far too painful so he lied and told him that she abandoned him. Dewey, who has overdosed on sleeping pills, then falls and Peter catches him. Before Dewey dies, he tells his grandson to be a good human being.Peter tells Cabot that he will take the guilty plea in all counts. The charges against Rebecca have been dropped. Dewey's life savings will go not to Peter, but to the many victims whom Peter had infected with HIV.

Their only daughter, Anne, is understandably upset. However, Cragen discovers that the crime was a homicide. The detectives have to tread carefully, since the couple had generously donated to a police charity as well as to the mayor and to the D.A. The detectives note that the security system for the Gillettes' house was turned off, so that a break-in wouldn't be noticed.Anne seems relieved to find out that her father didn't kill her mother and then himself. She suggests that a burglar must have killed them, but because the crime was so brutal, there must be some personal vendetta against them. Anne recalls that there is a man she noticed who has been stalking her.After tracking Anne's movements through an art gallery where she bought art, and a jewelry store, the detectives discover the identity of the man following her. The man, Ashok Ramsey, is in actually a detective investigating Anne for fraud. This suggests that Anne is the true suspect. Ramsey is on a ""shadow"" operation, where his C.O. will deny that Ramsey is working this case. Anne spent through her trust fund from her parents and she has stolen millions of dollars from a charitable organization called the Prestwick Foundation. Ramsey suspects that Anne killed her parents for the money, since she is their sole heir.Ramsey explains that Anne has evaded paying taxes and has been sued various times for her work as an interior designer. She had stolen money from the Prestwick Foundation, making donations to recipients which turned out to be for her. She has an accomplice, but Ramsey hasn't been able to identify him.Nigel Prestwick and Chief of Detectives Muldrew order the Prestwick investigation closed, since the money has already been replaced, and it would be a P.R. nightmare if word of the incident got out. But the murder of the Gillettes is still an ongoing investigation, even if the Prestwick case is closed. Ramsey decides to work with Benson and Stabler in order to get Anne. They decide to keep up the story that Ramsey is Anne's stalker and bring him into the precinct. Benson informs Anne that they're finding it hard to link Ramsey to the crime scene. Anne suggests that one of her friends, Nathan Harding, can help. However, she wants to make sure Nate wants to help out and asks to get in touch with him first. The detectives suspect that Nate is Anne's accomplice.Benson and Stabler track Nate down and he confirms that he helped Anne steal the money, and that he thoroughly believed that Anne was in love with him. Cragen thinks there still isn't enough evidence to link Anne to the murders, so he tells them to get Anne on witness tampering charges for coaching Nate on what to say to the detectives. Anne is brought in during her parents' funeral. Dr. Huang says that Anne is a sociopath, so Benson should make sure she is comfortable. Muldrew then comes in and tells Cragen that they should not have brought Anne in. Huang informs Muldrew that Anne shouldn't be out wandering around because she is dangerous.Anne asks to speak with Ramsey in the interrogation room, and then tells him that she knew his mother and that they have a lot in common. Ramsey scoffs at that, because even though they both came from wealthy families, he doesn't want to murder his parents. Anne reminds Ramsey that his mother can be very seductive, which seems to affect him deeply.Ramsey wonders whether it would be worth it to press charges, since she could easily post bail. It would be easiest to get Prestwick to make his charges, since he's weak and easily manipulated. Benson tells Prestwick to get down on his knees, and when he does, Ramsey takes a picture. Backed into a corner, Prestwick agrees to go ahead with the embezzlement charges.Prosecutor from the US Attorney's office Camilla Velez is brought in. However, she is wary of taking the case since Anne's parents had been very generous donaters to many politicians. The detectives point out that if they're able to add in the murder of the Gillettes into the embezzlement case, Velez would have a very interesting case on her hands. She agrees to take the case. Stabler informs Anne that she's going to be arraigned on felony bank fraud and will be taken to Riker's Island. Anne tells Stabler that he isn't truly aware of what she's capable of doing to him and his family.Later, Cragen tells Benson that Anne has put a hit out on her and Ramsey. Cragen then tells the detectives that he's taking them off the case because it's much too dangerous for them. Benson isn't about to let Anne scare her away and wants to work with Ramsey in order to take her down. Stabler is annoyed that Benson is working with Ramsey behind his back, but Benson says that he still has to go deal with Cragen.Ramsey and Benson are at Riker's, ready to transport Anne to the federal prison before the trial. On the way, a van intercepts them and two masked men jump out of it. They shoot at Ramsey and Benson, who are both taken down. The masked men take Anne, who is delighted at this ""rescue"".However, one of the masked men is Fin, and he takes Anne somewhere so he can collect the rest of his money. Not knowing that Fin is actually with SVU, Anne trusts him implicitly. Anne calls someone as the detectives listen in, and Anne confesses that she killed her mother because she was going to remove her name from the will. She had to kill her mother to protect her inheritance. She didn't want to kill her father as well, but she ended up having to. Fin and Anne arrive at the hotel, and then Benson, Stabler and Ramsey storm into the room. Fin arrests Anne, who claims that she will find a way to kill them all."

The initial suspect is the lead singer of the band Vampyre Sacrifice, who is known for ""drinking the blood"" of his groupies. The singer, Trey, has an alibi, so SVU is forced to look at other options. Warner finds out that the victim had a blood disorder which made her blood difficult to clot. This might suggest that the murder was unintentional.A group of women enter the SVU, carrying fliers which feature a picture of their Jane Doe. The group's leader, Babs Duffy, claims that the victim was named Alyssa, and that the group, LesBe Strong, is a gay advocacy group dedicated to making sure crimes against gay victims don't get swept under the rug. Stabler threatens to arrest Babs for disrupting their investigation, but Babs says that she has information about Alyssa's girlfriend, Sharon.Sharon is brought in, and she seems a very militant, violent lesbian. Alyssa's last word before she died was ""Mitch"", which was her nickname for Sharon (a shorter form of ""my bitch""), but when Stabler attempts to call Sharon ""Mitch"", she punches his face. Benson ends up being the one to question Sharon, because she doesn't want to talk when Stabler is in the same room. The detectives discover another attack, this time on a woman named Rosemary, who was a part of Babs' group. She's distraught when she discovers that the attacker stole her Blackberry, and with it, all the personal information of the members of LesBe Strong.Now that Babs is a target, the detectives have to put her in protective custody. Benson is beyond surprised when Babs tries to kiss her, insisting that she is actually straight. Security footage is found of the attacker, who has a spider tattoo on his hand. Later, a call comes in saying that the attacker has been found and shot.The officers guarding Babs' apartment claim that they found someone with a tire iron lurking on the fire escape. However, the suspect doesn't have a tattoo on his hand. They search through his phone and discover pictures of him with Babs, looking very close and loving with each other. When Babs is told about the pictures, she confesses that she and Larry are in a relationship, and that she's actually bi. Larry was on the fire escape to help protect her, not to hurt her. Benson tells Babs that she has to tell the truth to everyone, in the hopes that this will flush out the real attacker.At a LesBe Strong rally, Babs says that the person who got shot was her boyfriend, which gets a lot of jeers and boos from the audience. Meanwhile, Stabler sees a man with the correct tattoo in the crowd and goes after him. The man, Ronnie, is the person who was printing out all of the group's fliers.Benson decides to bait Ronnie into a confession by claiming that she is a supporter of LesBe Strong and plays to all of Ronnie's fears about homosexuality. Ronnie's failed attempts at dating women must mean that something else is up. Ronnie tells Benson that she secretly would enjoy getting raped by him like the other women did.Babs thanks Benson for helping coax out a confession from Ronnie, and though her group lost a lot of members because of her own bisexuality, she'll still work on LesBe Strong as an all-inclusive advocacy group. She and Larry broke up, and she apologizes for the kiss with Benson. But to thank Stabler, she also kisses him."

Stabler thinks that Abby (the second victim) wasn't really a prostitute because she lived in an upscale neighborhood and could afford manicures. Abby was putting herself out on the streets to take money in for her drug habit. Her ""john"", Michael, claims that he didn't know either victim. However, Abby's body had evidence of his DNA on it. Michael's wife explains how religion helped him with his life.Michael says that he couldn't get his wife to indulge in his own sexual fantasies, so he started seeing Abby on the side. They were into role-playing, with Abby as a hooker, even going so far as to waiting on the sidewalk for him to stop by. He's vehement that he didn't kill either victim, and then a third prostitute is found with the same prayer card found on the bodies of the victims.Before Benson gets a chance to interview Gladys (the prostitute), she flees. She's found in her aunt's apartment, but doesn't want to say a word about what happened to her or who gave her the prayer card. Benson eventually gets Gladys to tell her story.The suspect, Billy Skaggs, is a religious fanatic who thinks he's saving the women that he murders. Billy is brought in a line-up, with Gladys ready to identify him, but when she spots him, she panics and runs, falling down a flight of stairs. Benson finds her unconscious on the floor, and finds out that she's pregnant. At the hospital, the doctor informs the detectives that Gladys had a concussion but the fetus is going to be fine as long as Gladys has medical supervision.Later, the judge agrees that Billy will be held without bail until his trial. Stabler and Benson tell Gladys this, and she tells them that she's going to keep her baby and change her life for the better. However, Gladys needs to officially identify Billy in a line-up of suspects, so the detectives revisit her aunt's apartment. The aunt confesses that she barred Gladys from staying there because of her risky life Benson finds out that Gladys used the computer just before she left, so the detectives trace where she went thanks to the adult ad she posted.At the address, the detectives find two men who deny seeing Gladys. In the bedroom, Gladys is found unconscious. Later at the hospital, Stabler and Benson find out that Gladys went through a seizure and the doctors had to deliver her baby 4 months premature. There's a good chance that the baby, if she survives, would have severe birth defects. The doctor suggests that they just withhold treatment and allow the baby to die.Gladys wonders whether it was a good idea to keep the baby, but Stabler argues that once the baby is born, the decision is out of Gladys' hands. Cabot tells the detectives that they have to get Gladys to testify, or else they wouldn't have a case against Billy. If Gladys doesn't testify, then she has to be charged with prostitution and arrested. Gladys, now attached to her baby daughter, doesn't want to leave the hospital for any reason, which forces Benson to arrest her.Gladys IDs Billy as the man who attacked her, but Billy's lawyer points out that Gladys never officially identified Billy in the police line up. During the trial, Billy tries to attack Gladys and he's taken back to jail. Afterward, Gladys realizes that the defense's picture of her life as a prostitute was completely true, and that she needs to turn her life around. Cragen gives a note to Benson, written by Gladys, where she says she's leaving to get her life in order and giving Olivia power of attorney over her daughter.Benson rushes to the hospital, where she finds the NICU team performing CPR. The doctor says they need permission to take her to surgery immediately to treat a brain hemorrhage. If they don't, the baby will die, but there's still a risk of brain damage even with the surgery. The screen fades to black as the doctor presses Olivia for her decision."

SVU is called in to investigate. Richard Morgan, the building owner, arrives on the scene with his attorney, Ingrid Block. Before Cragen can call for a sweep of the building to find the woman, Ingrid stops the investigation. The woman's body is later found in a dumpster. Munch recognizes that he has seen this same MO before -- 20 years earlier with another woman, Nancy Pierce. The perpetrator in that case, Daniel Hardy, is still serving time for the crime.Benson and Stabler speak to Daniel, who claims he is innocent. The victim is identified as Renee Simmons, Richard's former secretary. Daniel claims Renee's ex-husband Matt could be a likely suspect. The detectives locate Matt, but he flees. Benson and Fin capture Matt, who has a stash of marijuana with him, and take him to the station. Matt denies killing Renee and maintains that Richard did it. When told of this, Daniel mentions that Richard was the key witness in Renee's murder trial, who had delivered all the evidence that convicted Daniel.Benson and Stabler discover that Richard had been dating both women. To buy time with the murder investigation, the detectives charge Richard with fraud and embezzlement. Stabler assures Daniel that justice will be served and Richard will be punished.Richard is suddenly gunned down by one of his former clients, who had fallen victim to his money-making scheme. Ingrid witnesses the shooting, but she doesn't say anything to Benson, who is questioning her. Ingrid says lawyer/client confidentiality is still important, and denies knowing anything about Richard's shady dealings. She breaks down and admits she knows Richard killed both women.Ingrid leads the detectives to evidence that exonerates Daniel for Nancy's murder. Daniel is angry when he learns that Ingrid knew he was innocent all along and allowed him to spend 20 years in prison. Daniel is released, but at his hearing, Stabler arrests Ingrid as an accessory to murder. He had worked on his own without approval from Benson, Cragen, or Cabot.At Ingrid's hearing, Stabler mentions how Ingrid allowed an innocent man to go to jail and the defense brings up Victor Tate. Stabler had promised to help Victor get released from prison for a crime he had not committed, but the suicide of the true culprit meant that Victor had to remain incarcerated. Stabler admits this was all his fault. Ingrid says Stabler arrested her because of the guilt over the Tate case.Ingrid takes the stand and insists she had simply honored the oath she made as Richard's attorney, but finally takes responsibility for Renee's murder. Stabler apologizes to Cabot for arresting Ingrid rashly, but Cabot points out that there's nothing else they can do. The jury will probably convict. Stabler also takes Daniel to meet Victor and explain how everyone can make mistakes. Ingrid had been caught up in circumstances she could not control, the same as Stabler in Victor's case.At Ingrid's trial, she points out that the prosecution couldn't provide a link between her and Renee's murder. Judge Donnelly rules on the trial herself and declares Ingrid is not guilty. The detectives find out later that Richard's shooter had been tipped off about his location by Ingrid.

She insists they get in touch with her boyfriend, Jason. When Jason is contacted, he claims he and Lainie only got together once. Stabler notes Lainie is fairly promiscuous and has had a lot of one-night stands. Lainie insists that she was raped, and the only person who stopped to help her was an African-American woman who pulled her attacker off of her.After being shown photos of the tenants in the building, she recognizes the woman who had helped her. The woman is actually a caregiver to one of the older tenants in the building. While talking with Lainie in her apartment, Stabler notices there is a man who is watching Lainie's apartment through a telescope in his window. Stabler tracks the man down. Bryce Kelton matches the man Lainie described as the rapist. He also has a black eye that he received when he was punched by the mysterious Good Samaritan. However, Bryce claims that the sex was consensual. Cabot informs Cragen they need that woman's testimony if they want to send Bryce to prison. The detectives attempt to track down the witness, who has been identified as Nardali. Nardali apparently left her job as caregiver and cannot be located.Meanwhile, Lainie collapses while in court. Cabot and Benson learn that Lainie has flesh-eating bacteria that entered her body from a wound she got during the attack. The condition is fatal and she doesn't have very long to live. Cabot tells Lainie, now in a hospital room, they have to record her testimony before her condition gets worse.Stabler locates Nardali. He learns she is an illegal immigrant from the Republic of Congo, and she fears being deported if found out. Stabler promises nothing will happen if she testifies against Bryce. Cabot tries to convince Nardali to take the witness stand for Lainie's sake. Cabot says she can offer protection for Nardali, but Nardali reveals her past and why she is so reluctant to go to court. In her home country, she and her young daughter were gang-raped by a group of militia. Her daughter had died and her husband threw Nardali out of the house because she had brought shame to his family.Cabot and Benson discuss the case and Nardali, with Cabot believing there should be more aggressive action to help women like Nardali. Nardali agrees to testify, but immigration agents take her into custody afterward. Cabot hurries to the ICE office to argue for Nardali's freedom, but is informed that Nardali's husband is a known terrorist, which means that she might be in the country to cause harm.Cabot talks with Nardali, who says she was forced into marrying her husband and there are many other women in her situation. Nardali's papers are delivered and she is told she is free to go, thanks to some quick calls from D.A. McCoy. Nardali is willing to go to the witness stand once more, but not before the jury watches Lainie's testimony that she made before she passed away.Nardali tells of how she had to drag Bryce off Lainie and she had punched him in the face. However, the defense claims Bryce and Lainie's sex had been consensual and they were enacting a rape fantasy. Despite the defense trying to defame her character by bringing up her past, Nardali sticks to her story and even tells her own story of forced marriage and rape. The jury doesn't find Bryce guilty of murder, but he is guilty of rape and will be put in prison.Benson tells Nardali she is now a permanent U.S. resident with a special visa. Nardali tells Benson she is going back to the Republic of Congo to help other women. Cabot surprises the detectives by confirming that she is taking a leave of absence to develop a task force to give aid to the Congolese women who find themselves in Nardali's condition.

ME Warner believes it was homicide — the girl had been abused and starved, and had recently given birth. Cragen asks the detectives why they want to challenge M.E. Warner's ruling. They don't believe it was abuse that killed the girl; it was the car.The detectives review footage of the girl before she was killed and see another child running behind her, and both look as if they were running away from something. They learn the other girl, Carly Holbart, works on the farm. Fin argues with the manager of the market about the abuse of kids working on the farm. Fin finds Carly's address and goes to her house, and learns she had been evicted. Back at the precinct, they find out that parents Patrick and Madeline had been evicted from their apartment because of hospital charges from Madeline's failed fight with cancer. They also find out that Patrick and his other three children are now living in his car in the alley behind the church and others live there as well. The detectives tell Patrick what happened to Carly.Back at the precinct, Patrick Holbart tells the detectives he had sent Carly and Micah to work on the farm to make more money. He had not seen her in a year, and was shocked to hear about Carly's abuse and pregnancy. He thinks Micah could be in trouble too. Cragen tells the detectives that Mission Farms does not exist. Fin says what actually happened was Micah had pushed Carly into traffic and Micah had been arrested for prostitution and was being punished by being forced into the sex trade. Fin talks to Detective Cruz, and later the pimps are brought in. One of the men tells him that he knows who runs Micah. Fin orders that Micah to be delivered to him by the next day.Stabler and Benson get a phone call that Fin has Micah. As Stabler approaches, Micah attempts to run, but they catch him and Jasmine as well. Micah begs to be released and is terrified he will be punished. They bring Micah to the hospital and have him sedated. They bring in attorney Goldberg who says that he cannot help Micah because he is a suspect for killing his sister.Cragen asks Dr. Huang to talk to Micah. Micah reluctantly speaks with the psychiatrist. Micah tells the doctor they have been locked up on a farm and abused, and had been forced to have sex for money. Any babies are normally taken away, but Carly wanted to keep hers. Micah thought Carly was running away to be selfish and trying to escape while knowing the others would be beaten. He did not realize that Carly was trying to save him.The detectives meet with Assistant Attorney Chris Danielson, who says she can protect Micah's friends, but she is not sure about Micah. During interrogation, Reyes tells Chris she had sold the children to Liam and Julie Ryan, the ersatz farmers. Benson, Stabler and Chris look for the Ryans, and kick open the door to their house. They don't find the Ryans at home, but they find a room full of children. A brief car chase ensues and the Ryans are subsequently caught.Patrick is with Micah at the hospital as he recovers. He asks Micah for forgiveness for not protecting him. Stabler tells them Micah will not be charged, but he has to go through counseling. Stabler sets them up in a trailer and they are thankful for his help.

Evidence of semen is found on the body, and some of her hair has been snipped off. Fin points out that there's been a rash of attacks on women in the park, all with their hair cut off, and the detectives find the suspect to bring him in. He admits to taking her hair but he didn't have sex with her, and his alibi checks out.The DNA evidence leads Benson and Stabler to the man who had sex with Lindsay. There is video which confirms that they had consensual sex, and that he did nothing criminally wrong. However, Lindsay's husband, Greg, informs Stabler that someone had emailed him the video of the tryst. Munch interrogates Greg, and the man says that his wife worked for a soda company called Colanow, as the head of Public Relations. Lindsay apparently was addicted to cocaine at some point in her life but she was trying to get her life back together. Greg doesn't know who sent the email, but he thinks it might be someone involved with Colanow.Huang discovers that Lindsay had ingested poisonous mushrooms from South America before she died. The mushrooms would have impaired her mental state and aroused her, making her very susceptible to wanting to have sex with a complete stranger. The night of her death, Lindsay had attended a charity function for the Wishing Time Foundation. The detectives head over to the charity office, where Benson discovers a picture of Lindsay eating mushrooms from a salad.There was a party crasher at the charity dinner, a college professor and activist named Vincent, who claims that Colanow privatized the water rights in Bolivia. At Vincent's home, there is a pot of mushrooms boiling in a pot of water on the stove. Benson checks the pot, but Vincent warns her to keep away from it. Later in the interrogation, Benson suddenly passes out while talking to Vincent.Benson wakes in the hospital with Huang at her side. Stabler is still questioning Vincent, who is making a huge speech about water, while still claiming that he didn't kill Lindsay. New ADA Mika Vaughn wants to keep Vincent in jail until he can go to trial, but the judge lets him go. Vincent goes to the media to talk about his pet cause. Vincent's mushrooms did in fact kill Lindsay, and so Vincent's lawyer wants to go into a plea deal.Vincent refuses, fires his lawyer and hires a younger, less experienced one to take his place. Vincent begins to confess to the crime, but Stabler interrupts, saying that Vincent could not have been the culprit. A recess is called which allows the detectives to track down the true murderer. Meanwhile, Mika gives Vincent's lawyer a vacation which takes him out of the courtroom, and she's fired when the DA discovered what she's done.The detectives speak to Vincent again, asking him why he confessed if he didn't do the crime. It was all for the free publicity which would give his cause more exposure. Who else had access to Vincent's mushrooms? All signs point to Lindsay's best friend, Emma.Both Vincent and Emma are arrested for Lindsay's murder, but Vincent refuses to say whether Emma was involved. Emma explains that Lindsay was considered perfect in the eyes of Emma's grandmother, who runs The Wishing Well Foundation, while Emma was always considered the screw-up. Stable thinks that Emma killed Lindsay because she was jealous of her.Emma confesses to the murder after seeing Vincent watch her interrogation. The pair are in love, but Emma couldn't bear to see Vincent take the blame for her actions. Vincent enters into the room, accusing Emma of killing out of jealousy and not because of the cause. Meanwhile, Emma eats the evidence bag of mushrooms and has to be taken to the hospital.Emma's grandmother visits her in the hospital, and says that Emma won't be given any inheritance because of what she'd done. Vincent then arrives in the hospital room, bringing flowers for Emma and saying he forgives her.

Further examination of the body reveals she also had been sexually assaulted. The woman is an environmentalist who was at the plant to protest. The owner of the plant has an alibi during the time of the murder, but security footage leads the detectives to a man named Jason Gambel. As Benson and Stabler confront Gambel, he locks himself in his apartment and shoots at the detectives through his locked door. The detectives take Gambel in for attempted murder of a police officer.A search in Gambel's apartment reveals a box filled with personal objects leading the detectives to believe Gambel might be a serial killer who keeps trophies of his victims. Gambel panics. He has been in prison before and doesn't want to go back. He also claims he didn't commit the crime. The detectives discover a padlocked room in Gambel's apartment that appears to be a torture chamber. Meanwhile, Gambel still claims he didn't know about the room.The detectives track down the owners of the trophies in the box. A ring belongs to a woman named Joan Arliss, but she was raped in 1970 before Gambel was even born. Joan had given birth to her daughter nine months after she was raped. Benson speaks to the daughter (Vivian) rather than Joan because Joan has Alzheimer's Disease and is already near death.Vivian seems to have made a mess of her life, and relies on pills and alcohol. Benson sympathizes with her, and she reveals that her mother was raped as well. Benson also tells Vivian that her mother turned to alcohol to relieve her pain, but she ended up drinking herself to death. Benson later talks to Wong and wonders whether Vivian might be her half-sister. Their mothers were raped around the same time and they were in the same area. There is a handkerchief in the trophy box that Benson thinks might be from her mother. Wong thinks that Benson is projecting her own problems onto Vivian, but Benson is adamant to get Vivian's DNA tested and grabs Vivian's beer can to be sent to the lab.While in prison, Gambel's cellmate Walter Burlock, had systematically traumatized him, which explains why Gambel is so reluctant to return. Burlock was apparently living in the locked room in Gambel's apartment. Gambel confesses that Burlock raped the environmental protester. Gambel's lawyer says his client is a victim who fears Burlock.ADA Hardwicke discovers that technically the detectives had searched Gambel's apartment illegally, which means any evidence found during that search cannot be submitted in court. Later, Vivian arrives at the station looking for Benson and wanting to know the true identity of her father. Joan has since passed away, and Benson wants Vivian to go to rehab and into therapy. Vivian also spots Burlock at the station, who says he's innocent and claims that it's Benson's fault for not apprehending the real culprit. It turns out that Vivian and Olivia are not half-sisters.Later, Burlock's dead body is found in Gambel's apartment, and Stabler suspects that Vivian was the murderer. Vivian's son arrives at the station with a letter from Vivian for Benson that gives Benson legal rights over her son.

Lewis has a rape kit that she wants Benson to run, and it turns out that the supposed rape happened to Lewis. Lewis wants Benson to keep the rape secret, since she doesn't want her cover blown in an anti-government militia she's investigating.Benson tells Stabler about the case and they both meet with Lewis, and they convince her to bring them to the crime scene: Lewis's home. She explains that she was injected with something that caused paralysis, so she wasn't able to move or fight back during the incident. As the detectives keep an eye on Lewis, she ends up getting grabbed and taken into the back of a van. The detectives follow and eventually find the van set on fire, and the driver dead. Worse, Lewis is missing.The detectives get in touch with Lewis's boss, who informs them that Lewis quit the FBI a year ago and hadn't been checking in with him. Meanwhile, the detectives try to track down the identities of the kidnappers. They find Lewis, who tells Benson and Stabler that she's still with the bureau. Her boss only said she quit to keep her cover.SVU discovers that there is another rape case similar to Lewis's, someone had injected the victim with a paralyzing drug, but this time, the victim was murdered. Lewis takes a look at the known details of the other case, and how her attacker told her that it was lucky she didn't piss him off. The other victim, Jennifer, was a participant in a prison pen pal program, and one of the people she corresponded with is a man named Seth Coleman, a sex offender who was recently released. Lewis IDs Coleman as the rapist.Benson and Stabler go to question Coleman but Coleman bolts when Lewis arrives. She tracks Coleman down and there is a standoff, with Lewis training her gun on Coleman while Coleman has a nail gun on her. When the detectives arrive, Lewis panics and fires her weapon. The bullet ricochets and hits Stabler in the shoulder.Later at the hospital, Lewis goes to apologize to Stabler. Stabler tells her that Coleman admits to raping and killing Jennifer, but he won't own up to raping her. Benson urges Lewis to confront her attacker, which she does reluctantly. He continues to deny raping her. In court, Lewis's character is called into question by Coleman's lawyer, and he suggests that Lewis wasn't even assaulted in the first place. Lewis goes on the stand to recount the incident.Details of the rape lead Benson to a possible culprit. The rapist called Lewis ""Star"", which was Lewis's code name when she was working on an investigation which nabbed Brian Ackerman. During the case, Lewis killed Ackerman's son, and Ackerman and Coleman were cellmates for a while in prison. Coleman was sent by Ackerman to get Lewis. Lewis confronts Ackerman in prison, and while he gloats about what happened to her, Lewis hopes he enjoys his solitary confinement."

Months ago, she'd gotten drunk and passed out, and when she came to, she awoke to find Chuck in the middle of the act. Chuck claims that Bethany simply wanted more than a single hook-up, but when Chuck refused to see her again, she began claiming he raped her. Only Benson believes that Bethany is telling the truth.ADA Paxton returns to SVU to help rebuild her career after her suspension for being publicly intoxicated in court. When she finds out that there doesn't seem to be a case against Chuck, she orders the detectives to either find more evidence against him, or else they have to let him go.The university has a buddy system for drinking, to assure that drunk students don't get themselves in trouble. On the night of the incident, Kathleen was Bethany's sober buddy, but she left Bethany's side for a couple of minutes, which was enough time for Chuck to leave with Bethany.Stabler receives the university disciplinary file from Kathleen, though he's wondering whether the information would be admissible. Kathleen assures her father that as long as Kathleen gave the information willingly and Stabler did not ask for it, the file should be okay. Chuck's current girlfriend, Carla, explains that she was pregnant with his baby, but she miscarried after they had sex while using a special lubricant Chuck suggested. The lubricant contained ulcer medication which was shown to cause harm to the fetus in pregnant women. Chuck took the medication for erectile disfunction, but his lawyer claims that he didn't deliberately harm the baby.Paxton finds out about Stabler getting Chuck's file and is furious, but Stabler reminds Paxton of the loophole concerning the file. Paxton says that she has to subpoena Kathleen and get her on the witness stand. But her testimony, as she confesses to stealing Chuck's file, could get her expelled from college. Stabler pleads with Paxton not to allow Kathleen on the witness stand. Paxton agrees, and she'll tell the court that Kathleen was an informant.Chuck's lawyer manages to get the case's judge to step down, claiming inability to be impartial to Chuck's case based on an incident which happened in the judge's past. Judge Quinn refuses to go into detail about the incident, but the replacement judge is the one who ordered Paxton to rehab. When Paxton tries to request another judge, she's denied.Paxton worries that in light of the new judge, the case will be lost, but Judge Quinn promises that she'd help bring Chuck to justice. The judge goes to talk to Carla, to try to convince her to testify against Chuck. She tells Carla about when she was gang raped in college, but the culprits were never convicted. She tells Carla that this is her time to make sure Chuck gets thrown in jail.Carla doesn't show up in court, and the judge tells Paxton that if the woman isn't on the stand in 30 minutes, then the case would be dismissed. Benson finds Carla in her dorm room, unconscious. She dies, and when Warner does an autopsy, it's discovered that she died from toxic shock syndrome caused by the lubricant Chuck used to make her lose the baby. The detectives and Paxton trace Chuck down to a bar and arrest him for murder.

The detectives are assigned to investigate the death of a young woman named Caitlin, who received massive head trauma at a party. Caitlin was taken to the hospital and later died. Warner discovers that the victim had sex, but she can't tell whether it was consensual or not.Caitlin kept a list of all the men she'd slept with, and one of her partner's is the boyfriend of the woman who threw the party. Jill admits that she invited Caitlin to her party in order to get revenge, and she attacked Caitlin, shoving her against a mirror.Warner notices blue gel inside Caitlin, which turns out to be residue from a defibrillator machine. Warner thinks that the paramedics might have attacked Caitlin the ambulance. The detectives speak with the two drivers, eventually figuring out that one of the men would rob the patients and the other would rape them. Stabler believes that the two men would give each other up if questioned separately, and one of the paramedics, Mike, caves in, confessing that he would steal from patients before his partner, Tinta raped them. Mike is wired up and sent to speak with Tinta, hoping to get him to admit to the crime. Tinta suspects something is up and runs towards the ambulance. He injects something into his jugular and loses consciousness.Stabler tells Benson that there's evidence that Vivian may be linked to the robberies, but Benson initially doesn't want to track Vivian down, claiming that they might run into a dead end. Stabler accuses Benson of not wanting to follow up on Vivian because she's reluctant to give up Calvin. Stabler also says that he knows Benson didn't send the DNA sample to the lab, to find out the identity of Calvin's father.Cragen takes Benson off the case since Vivian's involvement and Benson's guardianship of Calvin could mean a conflict of interest. Benson tracks Vivian on her own, and she finds her, once again high. Vivian asks Benson to leave her alone. If Benson leaves, Vivian promises to give Calvin completely over to Benson. Instead, Benson arrests Vivian. Vivian confesses to killing Burlock, the rapist who attacked her mother and fathered her. Cragen chews out Benson and Stabler for disobeying him and finding Vivian. Suddenly, Vivian's friend Sarah comes into the station and claims that she killed Burlock.Vivian says she was trying to protect Sarah by claiming she killed Burlock. Sarah is arrested and charged with murder, while Vivian is expected to be sent to rehab via court order. Benson realizes that once Vivian makes bail for herself and Sarah, she'd just go back to the drugs.After Sarah and Vivian are released on bail, Vivian speaks with Benson, demanding that she be allowed to see Calvin. However, Benson thinks that seeing his mother may traumatize the boy. Gunshots are heard. Benson orders Vivian to stay put and then goes to investigate. Sarah has been shot dead, and Vivian blames Benson.Warner finds DNA evidence on Sarah's body which is a match to Calvin, meaning that the murderer was Calvin's father. The DNA belongs to Vivian's ex-boyfriend, David. He confesses to the crime, saying he killed Sarah for taking Vivian and his son away from him.Later at SVU, Stabler is with Benson and Calvin when Child Protective Services arrives to deliver papers to Benson, terminating her guardianship of Calvin. Vivian shows up and hugs Calvin. The CPS agent explains that Calvin will be put in the custody of his father's family as Vivian goes into rehab. Calvin clearly doesn't want to leave Benson's side, but Vivian grabs him and drags him away."

Her attacker, Eldon Balogh, enters the room naked and wearing a mask. Balogh attacks the boyfriend.Detectives Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler talk to the doctors at the hospital where Larissa and her boyfriend are receiving treatment and find out the details of the crime. Apparently, Balogh had shaved Larissa's body from the neck down. The detectives then interview Larissa's boyfriend, who talks about Larissa's fear of romantic intimacy and dislike of the name ""Brandy.""As part of her investigation, Detective Stabler meets with other young women who knew Balogh. All claim he had abused them and had filmed the scene.Later, Stabler searches Balogh's apartment and finds child pornography videos and photos on the premises. He also recognizes the secret trading symbols of pedophile rings, of which Balogh is apparently a member.When Larissa goes missing from the hospital, Benson and Stabler search for Eldon Balogh. The two are found in a room where Balogh is once again abusing Larissa. Stabler fights the attacker off Larissa. It isn't until after this incident that detectives review videos that feature Larissa as ""Brandy"" being raped when she was a child. Larissa admits she's the one in the video and that she has been plagued by fans of these rape tapes before and suspects Balogh is one of those fans.In police custody, Balogh admits he had been searching for Brandy for years and reveals that a man named Orville Underwood had led him to Larissa. Benson and Stabler visit Underwood's home, where they find him old and out of breath. They find a pillowcase in Underwood's home that matches the one in the child porn videos and photos found at Balogh's. Underwood's dried semen is found on one of the photos. Underwood, who was tried for statutory rape of Brandy, was not convicted and the detectives still don't have enough evidence to charge Underwood with a crime.Meanwhile, Balogh is murdered in jail after bragging about having sex with Brandy.Larissa claims she's certain that Underwood was her childhood rapist in a subsequent interview with Stabler. Benson and Stabler decide to investigate Daniel Brooks, who appears in one of the Brandy videos. Larissa positively identifies him in one of the videos. Larissa recalls Daniel, who she knew as a child, had buried jars in the backyard with notes to his parents in them. Larissa tells the detectives about burying a wristband from Daniel in her foster parents' backyard with a wish that Daniel would find her. The detectives dig up the wristband, and test it for DNA evidence. Using the DNA, they learn Daniel was reported missing in 1995 when he was 12 years old. Since then, he has been arrested for shoplifting and prostitution. He also lives in an abandoned factory in lower Manhattan. The detectives go to the factory and find Daniel filming child porn. They subsequently arrest him.At the police station, Daniel tells Stabler and Benson he is not a victim anymore. A psychologist explains that Daniel's abusive acts are a way for him to take control in the wake of his own childhood abuse. After detectives find books that involve sexual abuse of children hidden under Underwood's house, they charge him with conspiracy to commit rape. Underwood represents himself in the case. His defense centers on his first amendment rights and that it is not illegal to write about having sex with children. The prosecution argues that Larissa was hurt after Balogh followed Underwood's instructions for raping young girls, and notes that Balogh highlighted sentences from Underwood's books. However, without Balogh's testimony, this is not enough to convict Underwood and the judge dismisses the case.Larissa decides to get Daniel to testify, so she visits him in prison. The next day Underwood calls 9-1-1 and claims he is being attacked by a woman named Brandy. When police arrive on the scene, they hear a gun shot from inside. They find Larissa holding a gun and Underwood dead on his bed.It turns out Larissa couldn't control herself because Daniel had told her that Underwood is still raping young girls. When she got to Underwood's house, she caught him in the act of raping another young girl.Benson and Stabler charge Larissa with using deadly force to stop Underwood."

She doesn't have the time to consent to the kit.Ann's father, Captain Jackson, is visiting her in the hospital. Debbie provides details about the attack, and how the rapist had worn a mask and told her that he'd ""cure her of Falmouth."" Jackson is surprised at that statement and the detectives think he knows more about the case than he is revealing.The same mask has been spotted being used by a serial rapist in Virginia, and Jackson admits he may know the attacker's identity because he is a psychiatrist who treats sex addicts, but he can't tell the detectives who it is because it would break doctor/patient confidentiality. Stabler says that sex addicts can't be cured, but Jackson disagrees and tells him that he was a sex addict himself and believes he is cured.Jackson says he and Ann grew estranged after an incident in Falmouth. He can't remember what actually happened, but he was drunk and had sex. After that, Ann refused to speak with him anymore. Stabler accuses Jackson of raping his daughter. Huang figures out the mask the rapist wears is the Hindu God of Love and Redemption. He seems to want to ""cure"" women who'd been raped by raping them again. The rapist strikes again, but his victim manages to stab him in the forearm with a knife. The knife is taken as evidence and DNA analysis. Stabler goes undercover at Jackson's sex rehabilitation clinic in order to track down the rapist, who is probably one of Jackson's patients. Stabler hopes to find the one patient with an injured arm.

Stabler meets with other sex addicts and finds that one of them does have a bandaged arm.Stabler meets Courtney in the group, and she starts flirting shamelessly with him. When she catches him talking on his phone, she grabs it away from him and says she'll have sex with him in exchange for the phone. When Stabler refuses, she takes his phone anyway. The therapy session proceeds, but Jackson enters the room and is shocked to see Stabler seated in the circle.Stabler believes the rapist is a patient named Clay who has bandages on his arm. Meanwhile, Linda, one of Ann's old friends, goes to visit her in the hospital. Jackson confronts her and asks if she remembers what happened at Falmouth. Linda confesses that Jackson was drunk and had seduced her, but the sex was consensual. He did not rape his daughter that night. When Linda had revealed to Ann what happened with Jackson, she stopped speaking to her father.Stabler and Jackson are surprised when Clay's bandage reveals a freshly inked tattoo. If the rapist isn't among the patients, then he has to be among the staff. Brett, one of the other therapists, has an injury to his arm and would have access to all of the confidential information on their patients. Stabler calls his phone, which is still in Courtney's possession. She appears to be waiting for someone. Brett suddenly shows up, wearing the mask, and the phone call is disconnected.Stabler and Jackson rush to the bar and stop Brett before he can attack Courtney. Brett explains that by having sex with them, he's curing the women. Stabler arrests him.Ann is still in a coma, and Jackson tells the detectives that his clinic will be shut down because he broke confidentiality and a detective had been working undercover there. He sits by his daughter's hospital bed and waits for her to wake up."

Sunny confesses to stealing the tapes but only because she wanted to make sure that none of her coworkers at the Brooklyn DA's office were involved in the murder. The detectives more suspects in Lakeisha Watkins and her boyfriend Damian. Both were involved as informants to a case Page was working on. Benson believes that their stories don't add up. The detectives track the pair down, only to discover the both of them shot dead. A young boy tells Fin that he saw the murderer dump his gun in a garbage can. A new suspect emerges, this time one of Page's coworkers, who may have killed Page to get at the drug money. Riggs and Page were involved in a relationship but he claims to have never hurt her. Rivera's girlfriend, Gita, visited him moments before Damian and Kakeisha were murdered, which gives the detectives enough evidence to charge Rivera and Gita with conspiracy to commit murder. The detectives want to strike a deal with Rivera. If he cooperates, then they'll set Gita free. Rivera agrees, saying that it was Sunny who gave him Page's location. Sunny confesses to stealing the drug money, and she killed Page because Page was going to uncover what really happened to the money. Sunny is arrested and taken into custody."

Torres|12|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/flight-1372454/recap|http://www.tv.com|The detectives are called to investigate when a French teen named Dominique claims to have been raped by a man who'd flown her from France to New York. The accused is well-connected billionaire Jordan Hayes, so the SVU realizes that he won't go down without a fight. Dominique refuses to leave France to testify but she does mention that there was another girl with her on the flight, Nicole.The detectives note that sometimes a third woman flies with Jordan on these trans-Atlantic trips, his girlfriend Dahlia. However she wasn't around for this last trip. Upon questioning, Dahlia admits that she and Jordan aren't together anymore, but she did tend to Dominique and Nicole during one of Jordan's whirlwind parties.Jordan's private doctor, Ari Nathan, was called upon to treat Dominique after the assault, but before the detectives can talk to him, Jordan and his lawyers show up at SVU, claiming that it was Dominique who forced herself onto him. She told Jordan that if he didn't have sex with her, she'd start claiming that he'd raped her. Munch and Fin track down Ari Nathan, ready to arrest the man for not reporting that his patient had been sexually assaulted. However Ari claims to have not treated the girl. Stabler and Benson then speak to Dahlia just after she attempted suicide. French police contact the SVU and say that they have Nicole in custody. Nicole's claims seem to corroborate Jordan's story, that it was Dominique's idea to sleep with Jordan because he was rich. The detectives suspect that Jordan paid Nicole off. Benson and Stabler visit Jordan's mansion, noting that he tends to videotape his massage sessions. The team wishes to get a warrant for those tapes but are blocked by the judge. Munch sets up a blog which is purportedly Dominique's, detailing what happened while she was with Jordan. Dahlia had brought in young girls, on the pretense of being a masseuse, but in reality she was just a pimp for Jordan. The blog goes viral and other girls step forward, sharing their own stories of being chosen by Dahlia and then getting raped by Jordan. All the girls were paid to keep quiet.This is enough for the detectives to get a warrant for Jordan's arrest. Cragen and Stabler study the videotape footage of Jordan's massages. Jordan is taunted by his cellmate while he's in custody, and is so enraged that he attacks the other man, sending him to the hospital.Dahlia is brought in, and she's wondering why Jordan's lawyer isn't working for her as well. Federal agents take over the case, thinking that they have grounds to charge Jordan with child pornography. Jordan meets Dahlia, and says that he's taking care of everything.The detectives realize that Jordan will be staying in a nice white-collar prison and will probably not serve any actual prison time. Meanwhile, Dahlia still has to go through with her case, and unlike Jordan, she won't get off scot-free.

They find it suspicious that no one who watched the stream attempted to call the police. When they track down the room where the rape took place, they find it abandoned.The rapist has a tattoo on his arm, which allows SVU to ID him. He's a student named Carl Cooper, who was expelled from the university for sexual misconduct. Carl is arrested, and he explains that the tattoo is because he was a part of a fraternity. They decide to question the rest of the frat brothers.The victim is identified as Lizzie Harmon, who goes to Julliard and who has gone missing. Lizzie's mother has no idea where her daughter is. There is video surveillance footage of the outside of her apartment, and one of the students who visited her is IDed as Greg Engels. Greg was spotted at the same frat party Lizzie attended.Another live online stream is released, and on it, Lizzie is seen asking for help. The detectives are one step behind, however, because when they trace the broadcast, they find an abandoned brownstone. Huang notes that the brownstone is where Greg and his little brother Jason stayed with their foster parents. Not long afterward their parents' deaths, Jason was abducted and never found. Huang suggests that Greg may be acting out in order to gain some control over his life. Greg then texts Stabler saying that they should meet, in order to hand over Lizzie.Greg tells Stabler that he won't hand over Lizzie until Stabler helps find his brother Jason. If the detective doesn't help, then Lizzie will be killed. Stabler doesn't like giving in to blackmail, but he agrees to work on Jason's case. As Greg and Stabler speak, Cragen sends in a team of police, which causes Greg to panic. Greg tells Stabler that Lizzie is as good as dead now.Greg is arrested, but Stabler knows that he doesn't have the heart to kill Lizzie. There's something else at work here. Meanwhile, SVU is working on Jason's kidnapping case. They find witness testimony saying that they all saw a boy being pushed into the back seat of a car. However the witnesses all assumed that someone else would call 911, so none of the witnesses came forward. One witness saw neighbor Miriam Penner on her porch on the day Jason was taken, but she was never mentioned in the original investigation back in 2003. Greg says that he used to babysit Miriam's son, Daniel, but he died from leukemia. It may mean that Miriam was the kidnapper, who stole Jason to raise him as her own son after she lost Daniel. The detectives track Miriam down, even as she's trying to drive off with a sedated Jason in the back seat. Greg reveals that the rape livestream was just a set up in order to get the police's attention so that they'd find Jason. Before Greg is carted off to prison, he gets a chance to speak with his brother.

SVU has decided that they must work with the show to solve the case. Alisha Harding, the writer, gets a gift from the stalker and it's her sister's scarf, covered in blood. The team also discovers some more bloody evidence in Harding's home, including the police files from her death. Her sister has been missing for years and the case never solved. The stalker is obviously using the evidence to get to Alisha.The first subject they go over ends up being a guy who was going to a young girl's apartment to try and help her and keep her from sending e-mails to older men. The show decides to edit the footage together to make him look like a predator and they think Alisha might be setting the guys up.They take the first suspect in for questioning and he had decided to send the chat conversation to the police before he found the girl's address and went to find her. Alisha gives the team her house keys and ends up admitting that she had sent Laskey to jail for the wrong reasons.The producer of the show, Donny Spencer, tells the team that Alisha asked him to change the footage and tells them that Alisha had received some scary emails and that she brought in a photo of a dead woman in the snow.  Alisha tells them that Vanessa, her sister, was last seen at the spot where the photo was taken.Benson makes the decision to focus on Alisha in order to find the stalker. They try to focus on finding the men that come to the production office where she works. A co-worker tells them that Alisha made a video about the guy that is stalking her and that he should get what he deserves. They try to stop it but she has already published it to the internet. They end up thinking that Sonja, one of their fellow detectives, may be working with Alisha to solve her sister's murder. They find Sonja at an AA meeting with her neck slit on the bathroom floor. Right as she is about to die, she tells them that she got him. They swab her body for signs of the murderer.The detectives find the dead body in the picture and end up finding a total of five bodies in the same area. They are all mid-teens to mid-twenties and have been there anywhere from 3 months to 2 years.  David Adams is the only guy that comes up with a match. They find Rachel Grey who has been the ""ghost"" using that name and tells them that David is her boyfriend. He always calls her and she doesn't have an address for him. The wait for him to call and he calls from a burn phone in Riverside. They find him right before is about to attack Alisha.

The apartment above the artist's gallery houses the body of Ellen Sazelin, the CEO of a wine seller named Luscious Grape. She bled to death from a cut on her neck caused by a glass shard. Indication of forced entry in her anus and a high blood alcohol level suggest that she was raped while drunk.Benson and Stabler interview Ellen's neighbors, who describe her as quiet. One neighbor accuses the artist (Andreas) of being the culprit, but he ends up having an alibi. Out of leads, the detectives head for Ellen's company in order to interview the people who worked for her.Luscious Grape seems a fantastic place to work, according to the employees. Annette Charbonneau is Ellen's business partner and the public face of the company and she considered herself a close friend of Ellen. Annette claims that Ellen kept to herself most of the time, but she was also close with Bruce Clarkson, who is the company's head of advertising.When interviewed, Bruce reveals that he's gay, so he had no romantic interest in Ellen. Still, Ellen joined Bruce and his circle of friends, and Bruce convinced her to go to AA with him when she came drunk to work. She'd been sober for 5 years, which is why Bruce was shocked to hear that there was alcohol found in Ellen's bloodstream.Fin checks on Ellen's phone records, discovering that she received many calls from a single number. The calls came from a number associated with My Leather Fantasy, a store which specializes in selling Italian leather goods. Stabler and Fin track down the owner, Juan Alvarez, but he flees before they can nab him. Juan ends up getting shot in the gut by a man named Dennis, who accuses Juan of killing his wife.Fin finds out that Dennis's wife had Alzheimer's and mistakenly ordered $5000 worth of goods from Juan's store. Juan refused to take the purchases back, and also began to call her day and night demanding that she pay. She became terrified of the phone and one day her heart gave out and she died. Still, Juan could not have killed Ellen because he was harrassing another customer.Warner suggests that Ellen's wounds may be accidental or self-inflicted. Ellen also suffered from the impulsive need to pull out her hair, trichotillomania, which suggests that she was under a lot of stress. The detectives go back to Luscious Grape to talk with the employees again. Bruce claims to not know why Ellen was stressed. Corrine, the receptionist, didn't interact much with Ellen. Justin, from sales, also claimed to not know Ellen very well. And wine expert David claims that he loves working for the company and doesn't know about anything bad that might have been happening with Ellen.Morales uncovers several files which depict Annette verbally and physically abusing her employees. She even grabs Ellen at one point and drags her into her office. The detectives realize that no one wants to say a bad word about Annette because they're afraid of her. Benson and Stabler show Annette the video, but she's unmoved, insisting that the footage was somehow doctored. When given proof that the footage is real, Annette then says that she was driven to do what she did because of Ellen. Unfortunately, since there are no charges being put on Annette at the moment, she is free to leave.As the detectives do more digging, it's clear that Annette has been giving her employees gifts and bonuses to keep quiet. Huang even suggests that they have a version Stockholm Syndrome, where they must create an emotional bond with their abuser so that they can survive. Benson suggests that her employees are just greedy. Stabler finds out from a contact in the SEC that Luscious Grape is about to be bought by a multi-national corporation. Fin discovers that one of Ellen's videos is being aired on the news. Apparently she'd sent them the footage as well.Annette ends up being yelled at wherever she goes, but when she turns to the detectives for help, they're hesitant. Annette should suffer a little of the bullying that Ellen and the rest of the employees survived through. The news reports that the buyout of Luscious Grape has been canceled. Annette calls a press conference, where she verbally abuses everyone and then shoots herself in the head, claiming that they drove her to do it.Word comes to the detectives that Bruce was the victim of a hit and run. At the hospital, he claims he didn't know who hit him, but surveillance footage shows that he was talking to someone in the car before it hit him, and that someone was Corrine, the receptionist.The detectives separate Bruce and Corrine before questioning them, with Corrine claiming that Bruce ruined their plan by killing Ellen. Bruce claims that Ellen was dead when he found her. The employees confess that they had a plan to accept Annette's bribes and keep quiet about her abuse until after the buyout, when they'd all get huge bonuses. They worried about Ellen because she'd already started to become unhinged from stress, and Ellen wanted to show the world what Annette was really like. This would screw up the buyout, so the rest of the employees put together a plan to stop Ellen.Warner finds out that Ellen didn't have any alcohol in her stomach, which was strange since her blood alcohol level was well above the legal limit. On the lip of the broken bottle are cells which are only found in the anus. Warner says that alcoholics use this method to bypass the stomach and allow the alcohol to get absorbed by the bloodstream quicker, which gets them drunk faster. The detectives go back to wine expert Justin, who says that he did go to Ellen's apartment to try and seduce her. He ended up shoving her, which caused her to trip and fall, and drove the shard of glass into her neck. He made her drunk to suggest that what happened to her was an accident. Annette wasn't directly responsible for Ellen's death, but she did make everyone else as much of a bully as she was.

The victim is identified as Jerry Bullard, who works for an aviation company which does government contract work in Afghanistan. The detectives first suspect that Jerry was attacked because of his connections to the current conflict in the Middle East. Jane, his wife, says that he could have done nothing to raise anyone's ire. He's only worked on the actual nuts and bolts of spyplanes. It turns out that Jerry and Jane were frequent visitors to a swingers' club, so Benson and Stabler go undercover at the club as a couple. They meet Cassandra, a young woman whom Jerry was infatuated with. Cassandra has had trouble with her jealous ex-boyfriend, Doug. He's threatened Jerry in the past. Jerry wakes from his coma and immediately accuses Jane of stabbing him. He claims that she was jealous of how close he was getting to Cassandra. He was also taking their daughter's college fund and spending it all on Cassandra. It turns out that Cassandra and Doug work together to con men out of money. Meanwhile, the detectives uncover evidence from a case that Cassandra and Doug were involved in, where their DNA was sampled. The duo are actually brother and sister. The pair are arrested, but Cassandra isn't worried, as Jerry has already paid for Cassandra's lawyer, but not for Doug. Jerry is completely smitten with Cassandra, as evidenced by his final gift to her. He bailed Doug out, only to stab him in the chest so that he and Cassandra could be together without Doug's interference.

The victim, Marnie Foster, was reported missing the previous day. Evidence suggests that Marnie was sexually assaulted, but since no DNA was found, the penetration was done by a smooth object. Dr. Huang is away in Washington, so the team enlists the services of Dr. Cap Jackson, who notes that the killer still had some empathy for the victim, as they made sure Marnie was comfortable. A doll was placed with her in the bag. The autopsy reveals that Marnie was given sleeping pills so she didn't suffer pain during the assault. The killer didn't wish to murder Marnie; they might have taken the girl's life because they didn't want to get caught.According to Marnie's mother, the doll is not Marnie's. In fact the doll hasn't been made since 1989. As Benson and Fin head back to Marnie's home, they spot the girl's mother (Susan) arguing with a man. The man, Chet Hadler, had an affair with Susan. Chet actually has a police record, getting arrested for forcing himself on his previous girlfriend's daughter, and for suggesting that they have a threesome together. Chet has an alibi. Susan was with him at a hotel the night Marnie was killed.Cap wonders whether the killer is a woman, but Benson and Stabler dismiss the suggestion. Female rapists are extremely rare and female rapists who kill their victims are even rarer. Benson and Cap have a conversation over coffee, with Benson giving her condolences for the death of Cap's daughter. Benson also asks whether Cap plans to reopen his clinic, but Cap explains that he lost credibility with his colleagues for cooperating with police and breaking doctor/patient confidentiality. Cap thinks that the tenderness that the killer gave to the victim suggests that the perp is a woman, and probably was abused as a child herself. Maybe the doll is a totem for the killer's lost innocence.The detectives start to focus on the other adults in Marnie's life, which leads to her piano teacher, June Frye. June and Marnie seemed particularly close, and June is devastated with news of her young student's death. June explains that both her parents died a long time ago.Evidence suggests that June may be connected somehow with the murder. Cap speaks with June, who finally agrees to allow him and the detectives to take a look around her brownstone. Cap discovers some doll's hair on a pile of sheet music, and Benson finds pillows which match the pillow found in the duffel bag with Marnie's body. Luggage which matches the style of the duffel bag is found in the garbage outside of June's house. None of this is hard proof, however.Cap interviews June, who says that her mother was the one who first taught her piano, saying that it was where she could find perfection in her life. When June asks for a lawyer, the detectives have to make Cap stop questioning June, otherwise everything else she says can't be admissible in court.Cap goes back to June, explaining that he can't talk to her anymore with a lawyer present because she asked for one. However, June doesn't want to stop talking, waiving her right to a lawyer. As the detectives explained, it's legal if she changes her mind afterwards. June continues to talk about her past, with her father being the one who gave her the doll. Her father sexually abused her when she was 7. June confesses to giving Marnie the milk and the sleeping pills, and then sexually abusing the girl and placing her body outside the church.The detectives focus on the rest of June's students, most of whom have only good things to say about their piano teacher. One student says that she saw June arguing with an older lady outside and was acting strangely. The student tried to speak with June, but she was ignored. The older woman is June's mother, Elaine. Cap explains that June lied about her mother being dead because she wishes for her to be dead. Her mother covered up the sexual abuse June suffered from her father and didn't do anything to help. Elaine appears to be the killer.Benson and Stabler talk to Elaine, and Elaine is surprised to hear that June claimed that she was dead. Elaine remarried after leaving June's father, but says that her second husband was as useless as her first. The detectives then say that Elaine killed Marnie, then enlisted June's help with the body.Suddenly a young woman enters, Elaine's daughter by her second husband, Katie. Katie is Elaine's alibi, saying that she dropped her mother off at a bridge tournament during the time of Marnie's disappearance. When Katie denies having done anything wrong, Elaine verbally abuses her, which causes Katie to run off and hide in a closet. Stabler and Cap go back to June, and they tell her that they know she didn't kill Marnie. Katie comes in, demanding to know why June betrayed them by telling everything to the police, but June didn't say a thing. June is sorry that she left Katie alone with her mother.Katie recounts the day Marnie was taken and killed. Katie wanted to go over to June's house, and so June cancelled her piano lessons for that day, but Marnie, who didn't get the message about the cancellation, was there waiting for June. Katie took Marnie, drugged her and molested her. June then came home and helped to get rid of the body. Benson explains to June that Katie will most likely go to a psychiatric facility, but that their mother will have to go to court to address the crimes she committed against her two daughters. June feels like she can't forgive herself for what happened to Marnie, but Cap thinks that he can help her.

The baby (Jasper) is the adopted son of a well-to-do woman, Dede Aston. The baby's nanny, Imelda, is in tears when the detectives speak with her, worrying over the empty crib. A neighbor, Wade, claims that he heard screams coming from the apartment the night the baby went missing. A used condom is found in the trash and the nanny confesses that while Dede was away on a business trip, Imelda invited her boyfriend, prominent attorney Ken Turner, over.Dede arrives at the precinct to get her baby back, and Ken shows up as well. It turns out that Dede and Ken are engaged, and it was Ken's idea for Dede to adopt the baby. He knew a pregnant woman who was a drug addict, and arranged for Dede to take custody of the child because she'd be able to offer him a better life.Imelda claims that Ken doesn't love Dede and he promised her that he'd leave Dede as soon as he gets the chance. Imelda and Dede have an explosive argument, with Dede accusing Imelda of abandoning the baby. When asked where she went on her business trip, Dede confesses that she never left town that night. She was staying at a hotel. Dede then blows up at Ken for sleeping with Imelda and then tells Ken that she's pregnant. Ken is excited because now there will be a new sibling for baby Jasper, and even if the condom broke, having a baby is a blessed event. Benson notices that Ken's condoms break rather often and that he might be a reproductive abuser. He has an undeniable urge to father children and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Benson points out that Ken pokes holes in his condoms, which is typical reproductive abuser behavior. However, Dede is too in love with Ken to listen to Benson's warning.Wade, the neighbor, admits to kidnapping Jasper and placing him outside the children's gym. He believed that the baby was in a terrible environment and hoped that one of the other families who frequent the gym would take him in instead. Dede is relieved to hear the truth behind the baby's kidnapping, but Benson tells her that Ken has fathered over twenty children, and in fact, he's also Jasper's father.The detectives bring in Dr. Audrey Shelton to help with the case. She is an expert in reproductive abusers and provides insight into what goes on in Ken's mind when he tries to seduce women into bearing his children. Benson goes to talk to Bridget, Jasper's mom. Bridget is a drug addict, but it's clear that she regrets giving her son up for adoption and says that Ken pretty much forced her to. Audrey realizes that they can bring Ken in for facilitating an illegal adoption, without the mother's consent.Ken is brought in, but he doesn't seem to understand that what he did is wrong. Audrey says that she's never seen a worse case of reproductive abuse as with Ken. However, Ken is released from custody on a technicality. Benson confronts him with all the women who carried his children, along with all the children. Ken is still unapologetic, claiming that he loves them. Later, Ken is found dead outside Dede's home.The detectives see that Wade (the neighbor) is getting ready to leave town. Wade says that he found Ken's body but he didn't kill him. A wasp injection knife, which could have been used in the murder, is found in Wade's home. Wade says that he's not the only person who has the same type of knife. In fact, Dede has the same type of knife.There was a meeting of Ken's partners and children and Audrey was the only one missing. It turns out that Audrey had murdered Ken, as punishment for his misdeeds.

The detectives find out that Annette had been raped and was about to testify in the trial, so they track down the rapist assuming that he had killed her or had her killed.Luke Ronson, the man accused of raping Annette, claims that the sex was consensual. Luke appears to be a model citizen, volunteering to cut hair at the homeless shelter. He doesn't seem to know that Annette has died, and claims he was with his publicist at the time of the crime. The detectives search Luke's house and find a gun and a black hoodie, and get ready to arrest Luke. Luke says that he doesn't have a permit for the gun in NY, just in Arizona. However, owning an unloaded gun without a permit is just a misdemeanor in NY and not enough to keep Luke in holding. The gun doesn't match the murder weapon, either, so Luke is set free. Jenna spots him leaving the police station and becomes very upset.Fin and Stabler follow Luke as he heads for the homeless shelter run by Sister Peg. They watch as Luke argues with one of the homeless men there, Eddie. Eddie was the person who said he saw that Luke had a gun. When Eddie sees the detectives, he bolts and is arrested.Luke claims that he hired Eddie to scare Annette and make her life uncomfortable, but he never said to kill her. But Eddie says that he and Luke never agreed to that. Benson believes that Luke is telling the truth, and that Eddie was the shooter. However, they still don't have the murder weapon, and without it, they don't really have a case.ADA West tells the detectives that they can arrest Luke for witness tampering and get Eddie on assault charges for attacking a police officer. Eddie gets his phone call and screams at the person on the other end of the line before Stabler takes Eddie back to holding. Later Stabler is ordered to move Eddie to central booking, but when he goes to the cell, Eddie is missing, taken by the ATF because he's the key to busting a cigarette smuggling ring. Stabler cuffs Eddie and takes him away anyway, and ADA West calls DA Jack McCoy to help smooth things over.Stabler works with Eddie undercover with the cigarette investigation, but the exchange gets botched and Eddie escapes in the confusion of gunfire. ATF is pleased with the bust, but SVU has just lost its killer.The detectives track Eddie down to Luke's apartment, where Luke is being held at gunpoint by Eddie, who is demanding money. Stabler manages to convince Eddie to put the gun down and then arrests both Luke and Eddie. Eddie admits to killing Annette all on his own. He tries to bargain with SVU, saying that Luke told him a detailed story about the rape. If the murder charges against him are lessened, he'll give up the source of the gun he used to kill Annette.The ATF agent is confronted by Benson and Stabler, and accused of giving the gun to Eddie. He is arrested as an accessory to murder. At SVU, Eddie and Luke are in holding, along with the ATF agent. Sister Peg visits the station to drop off evidence, a picture of Jenna and Annette with an address written in Eddie's handwriting. Jenna arrives at the station, and Benson tells her that they have her mother's killer. They also have Luke in custody and they will go ahead with the rape trial. Jenna is brought to the ""cage"", and she asks about the third man in the cell. Benson tells her that it's the person who gave Eddie the gun. Jenna then shoots at the three men in the cell, and then starts shooting her gun haphazardly. One of the bullets hits Sister Peg.

Masters is a well respected and known basketball coach that runs training programs for children and professional players. Stevie is now living as a homeless junkie and talks to Nick Amaro, the new detective, about the abuse that he suffered as a child. He tells Nick that he was paid off by the coach in order to remain quiet about the molestation but everyone else on the team is unable to find any evidence or support to back up Stevie's claim.According to Stevie, his roommate Prince Miller supposedly received worse treatment than Stevie had. Prince won't admit that any of this actually happened to him and as a result, he resents Stevie. Later, the team finds Stevie dead. He had overdosed on heroin. It is suspicious that Prince Miller's manager, Supreme, had forced a hot s hot of heroin into Stevie. Supreme knew that Stevie was a recovering addict and he needed to ensure that his client's image did not get tarnished by the bad press.Prince confronts his old coach and decides to testify against him in front of the jury. Ultimately, Ray Masters is arrested and Prince encourages the other victims to come forward with their stories.

Detective Amaro speaks with Monsignor Kiata who makes some small talk before revealing that Ella is pregnant. After a conversation with Ella's grandmother, Amaro is told that Ella's mother wasn't exactly the best role model. Benson has a chat with Ella who tells her that she's never had sex – this was her miracle baby. Benson confirms that Ella is indeed pregnant and 18 weeks along.Fin and Rollins speak with Ella's estranged father. He doesn't care one way or another that his daughter is pregnant. Amaro goes back to speak with Ella's classmates. They tell him that Arturo, a boy in her class has a crush on Ella. Benson and Amaro go together to talk to Arturo and when they ask him if Ella talks about any older men in her life, Arturo gets a bit anxious and needs to use his inhaler. The duo, along with Munch, talk to one of the science teachers, Mr. Cordova. City records show that Mr. Cordova has been dead for fifteen years and he admits that he's actually Diego Ramirez and he's a registered sex offender. He earned his spot on the registry when he was 19 and had sex with his girlfriend when she was just 16. Benson revisits Ella and she tells Benson that Cordova had sex with her. Benson immediately finds some holes in her story and asks Ella to tell the truth. She also sees a bouquet with an anonymous note in her room.Benson and Amaro track down the florist who took the order for the bouquet. After going through records, they learn that Ambassador Andrew Raines had the bouquet sent to Ella. Fin and Rollins speak to the Raines' son, Tripp. He brags to them about having sex with her but he's taken off into a town car. Benson and Amaro find Ella in a heated argument and she says that she doesn't want to have an abortion. She reveals to Benson that Tripp had raped her at a house party in his parents' home and then sent her flowers the next day. Benson pushes to prosecute but because Tripp is also a minor and with his parents' status and legal team, he would be easily off the hook. The Raines' agree to let Benson and Amaro talk to trip so long as they are present for the conversation but once they go up to his room, he's gone. The pair go to talk to Arturo's mother who had been working as a housekeeper for the Raines for many years so its apparent that they would do anything to protect the Raines.Tripp's credit card records show that his card had been used. Rollins and Fin find the man who had used the card – Chase, a gay man who had found the card in a meeting place for gay men in Central Park. The detectives search the park and find Tripp's dead body. Once reporters get wind of the news they corner Andrew Raines and ask if his son was gay.The Raines' fired Inez, Arturo's mother and Andrew claims it was an immigration issue, especially with his upcoming run for office. Records show though that Inez is a citizen. He did give Inez a very nice severance package and paid for her housing. They realize though that Andrew wasn't paying the housekeeper but he was paying child support because Arturo is his child. Arturo tells the detectives that he had brought Ella to Tripp's party. Tripp had gone to Central Park to meet with Ella to tell her to get an abortion. He had given cash to Arturo to make sure it happened but he was so upset that he beat Tripp to death with a rock. Arturo admits that he was jealous of Ella's love for Tripp based simply on his status. All Arturo wanted was for Andrew to admit that he was his father.

With her face mauled and her teeth and fingertips gone, the only identifying details on the body are a couple of tattoos: a butterfly and a woman accompanied with the words ""Mother, forgive me"" in Russian. This is usually how prostitutes are marked in Russia. The sand on the body comes from Brighton Beach, an area with a large Russian population. Cragen doesn't want details on this murder to go public, because the Russian mafia might be involved.Amaro and Fin find out that the butterfly tattoo belongs to a woman named Lena. She recently got engaged to an American named Daniel. Benson and Amaro go to speak with Daniel, who panics when he sees the two detectives.

The man, Eric, is talking to his imaginary girlfriend and convulsing on the ground, naked. He's taken to the psychiatric ward of the hospital. While he's there, Eric sees another patient, Gia, being raped and tells Fin and Rollins about it. Both are a little wary since Eric had imagined his own girlfriend. Eric gives them a description of Gia and it turns out that his description actually matches. Benson and Rollins go to question Gia. She tells them she was heavily sedated the night before after being very upset. While she denies being raped, she allows the officers to give her a rape kit.Amaro says that the rape kit shows traces of male DNA and that Gina may have been raped. She was in the psychiatric ward for chronic suicide attempts, possibly because of chronic rape. Rollins and Benson go to question Gia's mother, Diane. They learn that Gia has a history of accusing innocent men of raping her but she is also mentally ill – just like her father. Benson and Rollins also meet Gia's aunt and uncle, Bella and George. They tell the officers that they're worried about their niece's well being.A few days before Gia was supposedly raped, she had gotten in a fight with one of the other patients named Jay. The officers go to ask Jay about the incident and he flips out. He eventually breaks down into tears and says that he had been protecting Gia from a guard at the facility named Charles Lee. The guard is known to force patients to have sex with him. When they go to question Charles, he tells them that Gia had asked him for a gun and that she had given him consensual oral sex. Gia confirms that she did give Charles oral sex but only so that she could get the gun which Charles ultimately reneged on. She says that she felt she needed protection. It was her uncle George who had come to visit her and raped her. She tells the officers that George had been raping her since she was 14 years old. George is later arrested for impersonating a doctor to have access to the facility.The officers question George and he tells them that he is in love with his niece. Because they are not related by blood, he thinks that it is acceptable. He also tells them that he needed to impersonate a doctor so that his wife would not find out about his visit. He tells them that it is true love, and shows them a love letter from Gia.

She quickly puts on her jacket and goes to meet him inquiring as to why he is there instead of Kathy. He explains Kathy took the twins to a birthday party before giving her a hard time about Ryan. Before they leave, he tells her he guesses he is cute.As they drive home, Maureen decides to change the radio station. Stabler notices a tattoo on her wrist. Instead of immediately telling him it is henna so it will wash off, she reminds him he has tattoos causing him to remind her he was eighteen and in the military. When she tells him he is acting too much like a cop, he tells her to wait until she has kids being sure to tease her saying they will be Ryan's. Stabler notices a patrol car pulled over fighting a fire on the beach. He pulls over to help telling Maureen to stay there, roll up the windows, and lock the doors. He retrieves a fire extinguisher from the back of the minivan and runs to the officers being sure to identify himself. One of the officers warns him someone is on fire. When the flames are out, he tells them to call it in while he removes the cloth covering from the victim's face. He hears a gasp behind him causing him to look towards the sound. He approaches Maureen and turns her away from the scene telling her not to look at it and it will be alright.The Morris Commission asks Cragen what kind of unit he is running. As he is handed two files, he is told one detective picked up a suspect while out bar hopping and slept with him and the other one fanta about killing suspects. After he claims the files were suppose to be kept confidential, he is told Jeffries and Stabler will undergo further evaluation and must submit written explanations to them. Cragen is told ADA Cabot has been assigned to SVU and he needs to brief her on their cases ASAP. Before he can say anything else, the Robbery unit is called. As he walks out of the room, ADA Alex Cabot attempts to stop him. When it does not work, she follows him telling him her assignment to SVU preceded his unit's behavior problems. He asks her if she is sleeping with someone before he asks if she has yet to encounter someone she would like to skip due process with. Before walking away, he tells her he will apprise her of the cases tomorrow because of his behavioral issues. She agrees to meet him for breakfast. As Munch and Jeffries arrive for work, Jeffries tells him of two uniforms and a detective being reassigned to Public Affairs. They question the reasoning behind reevaluating when the crime stats are better than they have been in 30 years. Munch believes the public fears tough cops. As they arrive at their desks, Cragen comes through ordering Jeffries to his office. She shares a questioning look with Munch before complying. Once inside Cragen's office, Cragen questions her telling the psychologist about sleeping with a suspect. When she denies saying it, he tells her he is limiting her field time so she can prepare a formal response for the Morris Commission. When she angrily tells him she will not explain her sex life to them, he reminds her this is not coming from him. When Stabler arrives, Munch notices his beach bum look and asks if Jimmy Buffet is in town. Stabler explains he helped put out a fire set to a victim's crotch who had already been shot in the head. He was on his way home from picking Maureen up at the beach so she sees it. He explains Kathy had to pick her up from the scene so he could work it since it was a dump job from Manhattan. As Stabler is about to head back out, Cragen opens his door allowing Jeffries out and ordering Stabler to join him. Cragen inquires about Stabler telling the psychologist about his fantasies of killing suspects. Stabler clarifies he said preps. Cragen informs him the Morris Commission is investigating. Stabler reminds him they are suppose to be ridding the department of rogue cops before asking if his job is in jeopardy. Cragen confirms it. At the victim's residence, Benson informs Stabler and Munch the victim is 42-year-old Andrew Croft. She tells them a Lexus, which is missing, is registered to the address and it may be the dump vehicle. She explains Croft was transferred to New York City a month prior by Radial Velocity. Munch questions what Croft does for a defense contractor. Benson continues saying Croft has a 16-year-old son named Michael who he argued with a lot. When they see blood splattered all over the bedroom and the mirrored wall. Munch asks if anyone heard the argument. She tells him the neighbors were all out before explaining books from MacArthur High were found, but they do not have Michael Croft as a student. She adds the books are bar coded. Munch tells her that he will take Radial Velocity with Jeffries if Cragen will let her out of the office. When he leaves, Benson asks Stabler what is going on. He explains that during psych evaluations he said he felt like killing child molesters. Benson believes the Morris Commission should understand considering they are all cops. Stabler reminds her they have not been to a crime scene recently.At MacArthur High, Benson and Stabler are told the book belongs to Michael Goren so they should speak with Mrs. Scheider, his counselor. When Mrs. Scheider tells them she needs a release from Michael's guardian to show them his file, they explain Croft was murdered so they cannot get one. She explains Michael was born in Belgium and could be a straight A student, but he is not because of some possible turmoil that causes him to hang out with troublemakers like Jason Sloane.Benson and Stabler locate Sloane playing an arcade game at the beach. When Sloane comments about Stabler's outfit, Stabler claims it is casual Monday. Sloane claims he has not seen Michael since he stayed over the previous Saturday so he does not know where he is. Sloane explains they are not close but Michael hates going home to Croft. When he responds positively to the news Croft is dead, Sloane explains he saw Croft slap Michael around. After he tells them some girl calls Michael from somewhere, he adds he is a teenager and will not do their jobs for them.When Munch and Jeffries arrive at Radial Velocity, they are greeted by Craig Prince and Ralph Noble bringing them everything from Croft's office that is not fied. Prince informs them he was a Guidance Systems Analyst. They refuse to tell them who Croft's emergency notification was and are unconcerned as to who will care for Michael. Munch asks if they will need a court order causing Prince to tell him to try. Prince calmly asks them to leave the dolly in the garage when they are done before walking away.In the squad room, Munch notices most of the papers from Radial Velocity are blacked out. Cragen arrives causing Munch to voice his complaint. As he joins Munch in looking over the papers, Cragen reminds him they are talking about national security. Munch continues his rant as he places a call believing something else is going on. He tells the person he called he wants to see him immediately.Munch is told Prince is being investigated because he is living beyond his paycheck. He disperses fied money. Noble is head of security. He is a Vietnam vet. He was awarded the medal of honor, the purple heart, and a silver star. The only thing known about Croft is he is a guidance systems analyst. The only people who would erase a past is the Department of Defense or the National Security Agency because he can guide a missile 600 miles in 20 minutes into a house without touching the doorframe. Munch informs him Croft is dead and Michael is missing. When asked how it happened, he answers, ""Bullet to the head. Bunsen to the crotch.""As Stabler wipes off his face after shaving, he hears Maureen scream. He rushes to her asking what is wrong. As she cries, she repeats, ""He's on fire."" He hugs her as he tries to soothe her.During breakfast, Cragen tells Cabot he does not care for city politics. When he questions if he can trust her, she informs him she intends to stand on his shoulders to reach a broader constituency so she would not do anything to shorten her grasp. Before he begins telling her about the open cases, he tells her this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Jefferies informs the team Croft was killed by a .38 slug behind the left ear at point blank range making the burning postmortem. She adds they do not have the murder weapon, but Croft owned a .38. When Cragen asks about Michael, Benson tells him he is still missing and so is the Lexus. Munch suggests Michael is dead because Croft may have found evidence of kickbacks against Prince. Stabler reminds him it looks like a sexual homicide. When Munch suggests it may have been staged that way to throw them off track, Benson is amused at his inability to let go of a theory. When the discussion looks to be escalating, Cragen steps in telling them the connection between Croft and Prince needs further investigation, but the boy is still missing. He sends Benson and Stabler to find Michael and the car. He tells Munch and Jeffries to see if Cabot is good enough to get a search warrant for Radial Velocity.Cabot clarifies that Munch and Jeffries want her to get a search warrant for a defense contractor so they can search for evidence in a sexually motivated homicide while dialing the phone. After Munch asks if she has a problem with that, she asks for Judge Harriman and identifies herself to the person on the phone. When she greets Judge Harriman as Uncle Bill, Munch and Jeffries exchange a look of disbelief.Munch and Jeffries return to Radial Velocity with other officers to serve the search warrant. When Prince tries to stop them, Munch threatens to have him restrained.Benson gets off the phone and informs the team the missing Lexus was located by the state police in Millbrook where the local police are watching it until they arrive. Benson and Stabler leave with Cragen's order to find something.As Benson and Stabler look around the car one officer verifies the Sadler family if not home. They are told Richard and Darlene Sadler live there with their daughter Denise. When Stabler locates blood on the trunk, he tells the other uniform to open it. They find a bloody newspaper in the trunk along with a gun.At Adams High School, Benson and Stabler inform the principal they need Denise to help them find Michael. He tells them Michael is in their mentoring program before taking them to him. Once outside, they see Michael showing children with Downs Syndrome how to play soccer. When the principal calls him, Michael verifies the police are there about Croft. They take their conversation to an unused oom. After Benson makes certain he understands his rights, Michael tells them he wants to talk. He admits to killing Croft saying Croft hit him so he hit him back for the first time. Croft got the gun threatening to kill him. They fought over the gun until there was a pop resulting in Croft's death. He wrapped him in sheets and put him in the car. Michael claims the next thing he remembers is driving to Millbrook. As Benson and Stabler escort Michael to their car in handcuffs, the hallway is crowded with people trying to figure out what happened. They show him support as Benson asks them to move.When Cragen, Benson, and Stabler arrive, Munch is still sorting through papers. Cragen informs him the papers can be returned since they have a confession. Munch explains the case was too neat. When Benson comments on Munch's inability to let go of a theory, Munch reminds them of the blank pages from Radial Velocity causing Benson to join his search. Cragen reminds Stabler of his appointment with Skoda. Stabler tries to get out of it claiming it will take too long to get there. Cragen tells him he has to go, but Skoda is at Christ's Church so he will have to go there to see him. Stabler jerks the paper Cragen is handing him out of his hand and leaves.At the church, Stabler tells Skoda he will not talk to him. He may lose his job because Jackson did not keep his confidence. Skoda explains she must have felt he was a danger to himself or others. Stabler reminds him he has never hurt anyone causing Skoda to ask why she would think he would. Skoda asks him to trust him. Stabler admits he has not been sleeping lately because he is afraid he will lose his job before adding he is angry. He admits he not only fanta about killing the perp but this time he fed him the gun and pulled the trigger until he caught him. He explains this perp is a good kid that tutors Downs Syndrome children, star athlete, and Millbrook's favorite son. He does not understand him committing cold-blooded murder. Skoda reminds him that in 14 years on the force no murder has made sense even though some could be understood before inquiring as to why this one bothers him so much. Stabler tells him his daughter saw this one.Stabler returns to the squad room telling Benson he talked to much again. After Munch and Benson tell him Jefferies is with Skoda, they inform him they ran Croft's prints through NCIC and came up with nothing prior to 1991 when he began working at Radial Velocity. After searching the papers received during the search warrant, they find a passport issued ten years prior in San Diego so they had the police there run the prints. The prints belong to George Kazinski, a convicted sexual predator of small boys.Munch and Jeffries inform the team Croft had eleven arrests, five aliases, and four convictions. They ran the search backwards through the arrests and convictions. When Cragen mentions only the Feds can erase your past, Munch reminds him Radial Velocity is the Feds. Cragen asks him if he has a motive behind the federal government sanctioning child sexual abuse. MMunch returns to Radial Velocity with Stabler. Munch shows Prince proof of Croft's arrests claiming the source is fied. When Munch sarcastically claims Croft's abilities took precedence over his criminal history, Stabler inquires as to whether it was okay even if a child was hurt. Munch sarcastically replies it is not their concern. Prince claims if he knew Croft was a pedophile he would not have hired him. Munch believes if that was true then there were no Nazis in NASA. Prince has Noble show them out. As they approach the elevator, Munch tells Noble there must not be much of a fight left in him. After Noble tells him not to question his patriotism, Munch pulls out a handkerchief telling Noble to take some of the tarnish off his medal of honor. Stabler steps in, grabs the handkerchief, and tells Noble they can see their own way out while ushering Munch into the elevator. Once the elevator doors close, Stabler returns the handkerchief to Munch asking why he is provoking Noble. Munch explains that as a war hero Noble fought for principles and he believes this mess is eating away at him. Stabler suggests Noble may not have principles anymore. Munch tells him principles die hard in people and he wants a shot at Noble's. As they leave the elevator, Stabler suggests catching Noble at lunch.At Rikers, Michael explains to Benson and Stabler that his parents died in a car wreck when he was eight and his grandmother's health was failing so Croft offered to take care of him. He tells them Croft went to his soccer practices. His father was a janitor at NATO while Croft worked there. Croft paid for sailing and tennis lessons for him. Once his parents died they moved from Belgium to Bosnia to Israel to Millbrook where he finally made friends and obtained a girlfriend. After Michael denies knowing Croft sexually assaulted an 11-year-old boy in 1990, Stabler asks when Croft began assaulting him explaining pedophiles do not stop. Michael continues to deny Croft touched him even after Stabler reminds him he is safe. As they are leaving, Michael's attorney thanks Stabler for the heads up on an EED defense. Stabler reminds him Michael has to admit it first before he and Benson walk away. Benson asks him if they are working for the defense. Stabler explains he believes Michael is hiding something because you do not volunteer to do hard time out of embarrassment. They guess it is an accomplice, someone who scares him more than Croft.As Noble leaves for lunch, Munch is waiting. When Munch claims money got in the way of his courage and integrity, Noble reminds him of the crappy military pay. Noble tells him Croft's abilities were crucial in the Gulf War. He explains Croft's convictions were never erased. A firewall was built around him so he would not be delayed at the border during the war. The wall should have come down once the war was over and he does not know why it did not. Munch tells him that because of the wall Croft was allowed to obtain guardianship of an 8-year-old. Noble apologizes before walking away.Cragen and Stabler update the case with Cabot. When she has her receptionist to call Justice, Cragen tells her they did not intend for this to become a federal case. Stabler reminds her of Michael's abuse causing her to remind him of Michael's denial. When she tells them that without Michael's admission, they are asking her to soft pedal premeditated murder. When Stabler accuses her of protecting her win-loss ratio, Cragen warns him. Cabot believes Stabler's judgment is impaired because of the Morris Commission and Michael fulfilled his fantasy. Cragen tells her he stands behind Stabler on this. Cabot questions Michael's future choices if they let him off on this case before agreeing to their request stating he must admit to the abuse or she will go ahead with Murder Two.Michael repeats his denial of the abuse even though he is told it was not his fault. When Stabler tells him he is a victim, Michael knocks everything off the table saying he is not. While observing outside, Cabot tells Cragen Michael is returning his own indictment of Murder Two. She apologizes before leaving.As Stabler begins to fix himself something to eat, Maureen makes herself known at the bottom of the stairs. She tells him she cannot sleep. When he asks if she is having nightmares, she reminds him that would require sleep. While she fixes him a sandwich, she asks about Michael. He explains Michael had enough of the man molesting and hitting him. When he questions why kids will not tell them the truth, Maureen tells him talking to adults is hard because they are always judge kids so they talk to their friends instead. When he questions who they talk to when they do not have friends, she tells him everyone has friends. He asks if she talks to Ryan. She tells him she talks to him more than he talks to Kathy.While Cabot questions the ME in front of the grand jury, he informs them Croft could not have been fighting over the gun when it went off because the shot was fired three to four feet away to the back of his head. Stabler informs them Croft was bleeding from a head wound and his crotch was on fire when he was found. Benson tells them the blood pattern in the bedroom shows Croft was in bed when he was shot. There was no sign of a struggle or forced entry. The victim's missing car was found in Millbrook with the murder weapon in the trunk by the state police. Michael Goren had the keys to the car. When Benson comes out of the room, she tells Stabler Michael is toast. He asks her if she is up for a ride.Denise tells Benson and Stabler she has been seeing Michael for about three months. She is reluctant to talk about Croft, but tells them he and Michael did not get along. She explains Michael would stay in their spare bedroom whenever Croft went out of town. He began lying about Croft being out of town, but Croft did not do anything about it especially since Danny Burrell and Michael stopped being best friends.Benson and Stabler have Danny pulled from wrestling practice to go on the baseball field and talk. After Danny tells them he and Michael are no longer friends because he is weird, Stabler asks if Croft attacked him. He tells them Michael swore he would not say anything before adding he cannot talk in front of Benson. She excuses herself to the bleachers. Danny explains Michael told him Croft was not home one day after practice so he decided to take a shower. When he got out, Croft was standing there naked touching himself while offering to dry him off. Croft grabbed him. He fought him off while yelling for Michael. When he opens the door, Michael is standing there so he ran. After that he told Michael to leave him alone. He believes Michael liked what Croft was doing because he could have fought him off. Stabler tells him Croft started abusing Michael when he was eight and could not fight him off before asking where a 16-year-old would turn when his best friend turns his back on him.When Cabot questions Michael in front of the grand jury, she tells him the evidence says his version of events is impossible when he sticks to his story. He denies Croft attacked Danny at first, but admits it when she tells him Danny will testify that he did. This time he admits his own abuse, but denies shooting Croft to stop it saying he was use to it. He informs her he shot him because he would not stop bringing his friend over. He met the friend on one of the friend's trips to Millbrook when Croft made him be with him. He believed it was over when they moved, but they moved across the street from him. When he refuses to name him, Cabot tells him a child molester only has power as long as his secret is kept. He informs her Croft and Prince killed a boy in Belgium when he was eight. He does not believe Cabot can protect him from Prince. Stabler and Munch interrupt Prince during a meeting to inform him Michael is charged with Manslaughter Two and the DA is willing to make him a deal. When Prince questions the relevance to him, Munch informs him he is under arrest for sexual abuse, sodomy, assault, and endangering the welfare of a child while Stabler cuffs him. When Prince claims Stabler is hurting him, Munch tells him it is not their concern. As they escort him out of the room, Stabler reads him his rights.Cragen shows the Morris Commission pictures of three victims explaining their most significant injuries. He tells them he stands by Stabler and others who see what they do and manage to keep their impulses in check.While Kathy sends Maureen to yell for the other kids for supper, the phone rings. Stabler answers and after a few brief responses thanks Cragen for his support. He turns around to Maureen standing there and Kathy asking for the results. He announces the Morris Commission cleared him.In the squad room, Detective Odafin Tutuola approaches Cragen as he is leaving to attempt to give him his file. Jeffries approaches asking if she can help. He introduces himself stating he has been reassigned. She informs him he is there for her job. When he tells her it is awkward, she reminds him she is the one being replaced."

Campbell & Jonathan Greene|2|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/honor-12349/recap|http://www.tv.com|"An unidentified young woman is found in a city park, having been raped, stabbed and beaten with rocks, then left for dead. A bloody rock is found nearby. Elliot and Olivia initially theorize that the woman was the victim of a ""wilding"" attack. The hospital determines that the victim had been a virgin.Pressured from the Chief of Detectives for action on the case, Captain Cragen tells Elliot and Olivia to talk to the captain of the park precinct. He cautions them that Captain Walson is ""a jerk times ten."" Walson lives up to that billing, so Elliot and Olivia also talk to one of his patrol officers. The officer tells them of  several recent incidents in which a group of young, upscale gangster wannabes had been terrorizing people in the park. Captain ""Not-In-My-Park"" Walson hadn't mentioned it because he'd noticed the pattern only the day before. Now he's worried about facing the Morris Commission. Just the previous week the officer had arrested one of the group's leaders, a smart-mouthed teenager named Chris Lyons.Lyons, his father and their attorney meet with Elliot and Olivia at the attorney's office. The teen admits that he and his friends had snatched some purses here, and leered at women there. However, he denies that they attacked the present victim. The lab finds the DNA of only one man on the victim, which eliminates the ""wilding"" theory. She had lost almost half her total blood volume, but the CSU technicians didn't find nearly that amount in the park. The assault was a dump job, and the attack followed the rape by about 8 hours. The victim had been wearing a Hanford University T-shirt when she was found.The university identifies the victim as Nafeesa Amir, a journalism major from Afghanistan. Her school record lists a post office box address, and her emergency contact as Daoud Tarzi. Munch and Fin go to Tarzi's address and talk with a man who identifies himself as David Hamoud. He says Tarzi no longer lives there, and that he doesn't know Nafeesa Amir. After dodging several other questions, including one about his bandaged forehead, he apologizes that he's late for a meeting and leaves.A Hanford journalism professor tells Elliot and Olivia that Nafeesa had faithfully attended all her classes, until that morning. Nafeesa had been amazed at the freedom of the press in the United States. Unless she sneaked out of Afghanistan, her parents must be in the States too. Nafeesa had been very close friends with another student, Annette Fleming.Fleming tells Elliot and Olivia that Nafeesa had been loving life, free from the stifling repression of women in her homeland. Hanford professor Husseini, a Mideast specialist, had been helping Nafeesa assimilate into American life. She had a boyfriend whom she never discussed, apparently to protect him. Nafeesa's father is an Afghan diplomat -- and a control freak -- who may have been looking for his daughter. In Nafeesa's campus locker, Elliot and Olivia find a photo of a man who may be the boyfriend, and her parents' home address.The detectives visit the Amirs. While his wife Aziza sits silently in the background, Saleh Amir acknowledges that Nafeesa is their daughter. Ignoring Olivia, he tells Elliot that Nafeesa did not know her place. She had chosen a man's work, and turned her back on her traditions and her family. In the family's eyes, she's dead because she slept with a man who wasn't her husband. The Amirs also have a son, Jaleel, who isn't home at the moment. Saleh asks them to leave him and his wife to their grief that their daughter chose a Western lifestyle.Munch recognizes the man in Nafeesa's photo as Daoud Tarzi, aka David Hamoud. After SVU arrests Tarzi, he tells them that he loved Nafessa. They'd argued about her father and his controlling ways. Saleh Amir didn't want to become known for letting his women do as they pleased. Tarzi wanted Nafeesa ""to stop acting like she's from some primitive tribe."" He'd dared her to leave him, never thinking she'd actually do it.A search of Tarzi's apartment turns up a bed sheet with a blood stain. The blood is Nafeesa's, and semen   on the sheet is Tarzi's. The bloody fingerprint on the rock from the park isn't hers or his, nor does it match anyone in the system. However, the lab got an odd reading from the blood on the rock, so they're re-testing it.At arraignment, Tarzi is held without bail. Saleh and Aziza Amir, who supposedly no longer care about their daughter, are in the courtroom.To find out why Nafessa's and Tarzi's romance was such a secret, Elliot and Olivia talk to Professor Husseini. He tells them that all the Afghan diplomats at the United Nations, including the Amirs, are holdovers from the pre-Taliban government. While the previous government had allowed Afghan women a sizable amount of freedom, the Taliban put women under virtual house arrest. Therefore, trying to return home would be very dangerous for the Amirs. However, that doesn't mean Saleh Amir isn't a Taliban supporter. Nafeesa wanted to live as a modern woman, and had to leave her parents' home to do it. In Afghanistan women have been killed for much, much less.Alex Cabot talks to Tarzi and his attorney at Rikers. Tarzi tells Cabot that Nafeesa was her family's ticket back to Afghanistan. Saleh Amir had promised her to the son of a Taliban government minister. Earlier the night Nafeesa was assaulted, Tarzi had given her an engagement ring, which she accepted. They then had consensual sex, after which she had a change of heart and left him. Tarzi hadn't revealed any of this earlier because his forehead injury was inflicted by a police officer, sent by Saleh Amir to find Nafeesa.Munch and Fin find the officer, Ross Campo. He's illegally moonlighting as a private investigator. To keep Internal Affairs from learning of his sideline, Campo reveals that Saleh Amir hired his second employer to find Nafeesa. The family was returning to their home country, and wanted her to go with them. Campo tracked Nafeesa as far as Tarzi, who denied knowing her and refused to reveal anything about her even after Campo conked him. The lab's re-test of the blood on the rock reveals two types of DNA: one Nafeesa's, the other not Tarzi's. The second DNA type is similar to Nafeesa's, meaning it belongs to a relative. The hospital informs SVU that Nafeesa is dead. Cabot asks about Jaleel Amir, who recently graduated from New York University and celebrated his 21st birthday. Since he's not currently enrolled in school, his diplomatic immunity expired on his birthday.Elliot and Olivia talk to the doorman at the Amirs' apartment building. He remembers seeing a sobbing Nafeesa there, at about 7:00 the night she was attacked. An hour later Jaleel called him, wanting him to bring up the big shopping cart. Already resentful of Jaleel's treating him like a personal slave, the doorman had refused, saying he couldn't leave the desk. If Jaleel did fetch the cart himself, he must have exited through the building garage because he didn't come through the front door.Realizing that Nafeesa's death was definitely an honor killing, Elliot and Olivia visit the Amirs again and demand to know where Jaleel is. This time Olivia doesn't let Saleh Amir ignore her. He belligerently tells her his daughter was a whore, just like Olivia (an unmarried woman with a job, and working alongside men to boot). Aziza Amir speaks up, and tells them that Jaleel is on his way back to Afghanistan.Munch and Fin go to the airport and board the Kabul-bound plane, which hasn't left yet. They find and arrest Jaleel Amir. Without any prompting, Jaleel smiles broadly and says, ""I'm proud I killed her. She deserved to die.""When Jaleel's defense attorney can't get the confession thrown out, he changes his client's plea to not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. Honor killings are so ingrained in Jaleel's native culture, Jaleel didn't know that killing his sister was wrong.The judge orders a psychiatric examination, which is conducted by Dr. Emil Skoda. Jaleel now acts like a basket case, and constantly fingers a strand of traditional Afghan beads. As a boy in Afghanistan, Jaleel had been forced to watch his aunt's honor killing by his grandfather. Jaleel has had nightmares about the experience ever since. Cabot realizes that a jury might be just as confused as Jaleel seems to be. Skoda tells Cabot she has to find a jury who can see past the confusion.The trial begins. In the courtroom Jaleel is still fingering the beads, and now also wears a traditional Afghan cap. Munch testifies that Jaleel had been wearing Western clothing on the plane, and freely admitted to killing Nafeesa before Munch and Fin could read him his rights. Jaleel insists he killed his sister to restore his family's honor.Cabot becomes concerned that the jury is buying Jaleel's mental-disease-or-defect defense. The prosecution is out of people to say otherwise. Olivia points out that they still have one more ally: Aziza Amir. Cragen and Fin both object, with Fin pointing out that if Aziza testifies, she'll be condemning herself to death. Olivia replies that Aziza wants justice for Nafeesa's memory, as evidenced by her defying her husband to reveal that Jaleel was returning to Afghanistan. If they reach out to her again, she might help them. Fin says that if they ask Aziza to do this, they have to be ready to protect her. Cragen says they're ready. Aziza tearfully says she doesn't want their protection; she wants her daughter.On the witness stand, Aziza Amir tearfully but resolutely testifies that after leaving Tarzi, Nafeesa came home to rejoin her family. Saleh asked if she was still a virgin. She wasn't. Saleh hit Nafeesa, knocking her down. When Jaleel tried to help her, Saleh said, ""Let her lie there like she lies with her American boyfriend."" Saleh then gave a kitchen knife to a terrified and unwilling Jaleel, and told him to kill Nafeesa to restore their family's honor and prove his own manhood. Reluctantly, Jaleel stabbed his sister. Then he and his father took her away.The jury convicts Jaleel Amir of murder. Cabot calls Cragen with the news, then comments that after attending every day of the trial, Saleh Amir had not been in the courtroom for the verdict.

Lloyd Andrews and his wife, Patricia, yelling. He approaches his window in time to see Patricia throw a skillet at Sgt. Andrews as he is walking away. Sgt. Andrews returns to her and grabs her hair ushering her back into the building with her screaming.In the squad room, Munch tries to explain to Patricia that according to procedure they must go to the hospital for her exam before taking her statement in order to preserve as much evidence as possible. She believes her husband will get away with raping her. Munch attempts to allow her to speak with a female detective, but she tells him she would like to speak with anyone with a brain. He asks her not to try to go through all of the five stages of grief at once. She explains she does not need him to explain procedure and refuses a rape kit. He explains it does not matter if she has had or is still in a relationship with the man causing her to tell him it was her husband. He motions to Tutuola as he asks her for an address in order to find him. She tells them he is at Manhattan South. He is Sgt. Lloyd Andrews of Homicide.After everyone else has entered Cragen's office for a meeting, he asks Jefferies if she is going to join them. She declines stating she has reports to file and coffee to make. He approaches her stating that he wants her on his team as long as she wants to be. She tells him the files are not going to file themselves before walking off. He joins the group in his office.Tutuola begins stating Patricia claims her husband raped her, but a sprained wrist is the only sign of physical abuse. Benson points out she does not need to be abused to prove rape. Munch adds the man accused is in Homicide at Manhattan South. Tutuola explains he did not mention it because it is not important to him. Stabler adds Sgt. Andrews is a 20-year vet with citations and a high closure rate. Benson reminds him that even though the guy makes the Brass happy, he is still a rapist. Munch corrects her saying he is an alleged rapist. Benson asks if he has ever heard of the word no. Munch asks if she has heard of contractual abandonment saying the only reason to get married is so you do not have to hear the word no. Stabler explains he has been married 16 years and he hears it all the time. Benson reminds them the concept of a wife being property went out in 1984 when the law realized a wife has the right to say no. Cragen intervenes asking if they were able to get Patricia's statement with her signature. Tutuola answers saying it is being typed. Cragen wants Patricia to know the score before she signs it. Tutuola questions if he doubts what happened or her commitment. Cragen reminds him that since the suspect is a cop Internal Affairs will be involved. When Tutuola comments he does not think his badge should cushion the blow, Cragen asks if he has ever rubbed IAB the wrong way. When he denies having had the pleasure, Cragen tells him to do it his way. Cragen sends Benson and Stabler to canvass the neighbors for background on the couple. He tells Munch and Tutuola talk to Patricia before stating he will inform the ""powers that be."" Stabler reminds Cragen that if the rape occurred and they did not follow procedure then they will get buried. Cragen informs him that will happen either way.Munch and Tutuola join a smoking Patricia in the interview room. Munch immediately tells her smoking is prohibited in government buildings. After blowing a puff of smoke in his face, she puts the cigarette out on the sole of her shoe. Tutuola gives her the typed statement telling her to read and sign it before asking where Sgt. Andrews is now. She explains he plays pick-up ball every afternoon before his shift with some friends. Munch tells her to repeat her story in her own words before she signs the statement explaining she is going to have to get used to telling her story. She ignores him asking Tutuola if he is married. When he denies it, she tells Munch she knows he is not married because no one would have him. He asks if she is always this pleasant causing her to ask if he thought she deserved to be raped. Tutuola steps in saying he does not believe anyone deserves it. She explains they have been married for five years. They fight, then make love. She can hardly believe it happened. Munch asks if they could have been making up. She explains she does call a choke hold foreplay. He reminds her she threw the pot to his head causing her to doubt if anything will be done to him. As she tries to leave, Munch explains that if her story holds up he is going to have to arrest him, cuff him, process him, and stick him in a cage. She returns to the table to sign her statement. When Benson and Stabler attempt to speak with Cyrus Parker about the Andrews, Parker reminds them that people barely look at each other and rarely introduce themselves. He calls them the Springers because their fights are better than the show. He explains they fight every day. Sometimes the police come, but they leave after Andrews talks to them briefly. He tells them what he saw earlier in the day denying seeing Andrews strike Patricia. Detectives Santiago and Howard of Internal Affairs visit with Cragen. When Howard tries to shake his hand, Cragen stares at it before asking if the case stays at SVU. Howard explains IAB is not equipped to handle sex crimes causing Cragen to tell them to ""Have a nice day,"" in an effort to have them leave. Howard informs Cragen they know IAB used him to bring down his mentor, but assures him those were the old days. They ask him to take the case slow and easy with finesse and kid gloves. They explain that Andrews is not on the take. They do not understand how a wife can be raped. Benson walks out of the store carrying two cups of coffee while Stabler is on the phone. When he hangs up, he explains uniforms were dispatched four times to the Andrews residence for domestic disputes. Clarkson and Powell always responded, but handled it at the scene with no arrests. They are on tour, but just signed out for a break. Benson and Stabler walk up to Clarkson and Powell at the end of an old joke which Benson finishes for them. As they join them in the booth, Stabler explains they want to discuss the Andrews DIRs. They explain they handled them at the scene each time, but on the last call they told Andrews if it happened again they would have no choice. Stabler tells them four calls in three too many because you take action the first time. They claim they did it because Andrews is a fellow cop who asked a favor. Benson reminds them looking the other way should not have been an option. She explains that since they did not do their job, they caught the case. They tell them Andrews and Patricia fight loud and hard calling each other names he would not call anyone. Patricia is the violent one throwing whatever is handy when she gets ticked off. Stabler explains to Cragen that Patricia is the violent one and Andrews seems to be handling it. When Stabler comments he is not a fly on their bedroom wall, Cragen wonders what Andrews's response will be when they ask if he raped his wife. Stabler wants to let the ADA decide. Cragen informs him that for the first time IAB wants to flush it so either they have another reason or the case is going to come back to bite them. Stabler wants to interview Andrews, but Cragen believe an SBA lawyer will shut him up. When Cragen asks if he has another idea, Stabler reminds him that unless it is official it will not hold up in court. Cragen tells him he just wants a read on the guy. Stabler joins Andrews, Cesar Vasques of Vice, and Danny Tatum of Homicide in a game of basketball. After he introduces himself, Tatum acknowledges SVU is a tough gig. Andrews hears they rotate the detectives out every two years in SVU. Stabler plays it off saying Homicide is tough as well, but Andrews tells him bodies do not care if you close cases unlike live victims. While playing, Tatum shoves Stabler causing him to wonder what his problem is. Tatum tells him there are no fouls on the blacktop and asks if he can take it. When they try again, Tatum hits Stabler with his elbow causing him to bleed from his nose. Stabler asks what he missed. Andrews tells him Tatum was trying to send him a message, but he denies he works that way. He promises to answer all of his questions after the game. In Cragen's office, Stabler tells the team Andrews may have just been telling him what he wanted to hear, but he believes he was being genuine. Benson asks him if it was before or after Tatum beat him because she believes Andrews knew they were looking at him. Munch believes Tatum just got over zealous in protecting his partner reminding him Andrews stepped in and saved the other eye and hopes Tutuola would do the same for him. Tutuola tells him they need some history first. Cragen recounts that they have an abusive women claiming she was raped. Tutuola believes she may lie because she wants a divorce and it will be easier to get what she wants if he is in jail. Benson tells them there have not been any papers filed. Munch tells them she may want them to take care of him first before filing. Cragen answers the phone and informs the team a unit was dispatched to the Andrews residence for assault with a deadly weapon after Parker called it in. When Benson and Stabler arrive at the scene, Patricia is being held back by an officer. She  tells Andrews, who is sitting in the back of an ambulance, she will cut his heart out if he touches her again. She threatens to wait until he is asleep and set him on fire. Andrews tells her she had better kill him or he will do her without leaving a mark. She grabs the officer's baton and throws it at him. When another officer tries to take her in, Benson tells him not to and takes control of Patricia ushering her to a patrol car. Stabler approaches Andrews and tells him they need him to come to the station to answer questions. Andrews tells him he thinks he needs a lawyer. Stabler agrees. In Cragen's office, Santiago tells Cragen he is getting calls from the Brass asking if he is working an undercover operation with SVU with the press knowing. When he ask what kind of Mickey Mouse Club he is running, Cragen tells him he prefers Dick Tracy because of the decoder ring and a watch. Howard asks ADA Cabot if she is going to say anything. Santiago clarifies asking if she is going to charge Andrews, if she is going to reign in her squad, and if she will keep them updated on the case. She informs him that charging Andrews prior to a formal statement is premature. She is not going to sweep this case under the rug like they want. She warns them to stop interfering in the unit's investigation or she will charge them as co-conspirators. Santiago tells her they are only there to supervise, but is told not any more. She tells them they may consider themselves officially updated causing Cragen to smile behind her. After Stabler and Benson escort him into the interview room, Andrews announces he will not talk to them without his lawyer. They tell him they are done and turn to walk out, but are called back by him saying he wants to get it over with so they can all get back to work. When Benson tells him they have his wife's side of the story so they need his, he questions what she told them. Stabler informs him she claims he raped her before telling him to explain what happened instead of denying it. Andrews tells them he works midnights. When he got home she started on him concerned he was having an affair. He admits to the affair, but claims she is accusing him of rape because she is angry. He explains she is always upset about something. He smothers her or he does not love her. He wants them to figure it out because she is driving him nuts. Stabler suggests divorce is better than rape causing Andrews to shout his denial.Patricia tells Munch and Tutuola that her husband came home as if nothing happened. She did not want to leave him because she does not have anywhere else to go. She claims the home belongs to her and her things are there. Munch reminds her she cut Andrews with a knife and threw the baton into the crowd. She claims she was scared when he walked in expecting him to be in jail. Tutuola asks if she has anyone she can stay with for a while. She wonders why they did not arrest him.Andrews explains he tried to walk away from her because tempers were getting out of hand. She nailed him with a pot in the back of the head. Stabler reminds him he did not keep walking, but went after her. Benson asks if that was when her raped Patricia. He told her nice try. He started packing her bags. He explains the lease is in his name and she is not going to run him out of the house screaming and threatening him with kitchen utensils. He claims she came after him with a knife and he disarmed her with a standard academy move. He informs them Patricia has not been right since learning she cannot have kids. Patricia claims she did not divorce him because she loves Andrews. She wants to try counseling, but he refuses to go. She believes the court will make him go to counseling after the trial. Tutuola tells her they will if he is convicted. Munch informs her they may not be able to charge him causing her to question who makes that decision. Munch tells her that would be Cabot. She thinks Cabot will understand since she is a woman. When Andrews claims they made love, Stabler asks if he held her down or used a choke-hold on her. He denies he ever uses holds on Patricia because he knows he could hurt her. He wonders why they are asking him questions like that when he is the one with the marks. Benson reminds him he told Patricia at the scene that he could do her without leaving a mark. After viewing the interview with Andrews from his office, Cragen tells Cabot it is her call if they charge him or not. She wants to cut him loose. He reminds her if they do not charge him , then they are sending the message to every wife that if she gets raped she had better get beat up as well. He wants Andrews booked so a jury can decide if he is guilty, but Cabot does not believe they have enough evidence to get past the grand jury. She tells him to walk him before leaving. He follows her out of his office to find Tatum and other detectives standing in the squad room. Tatum asks him if Andrews is getting pinched. When Cragen tells him it does not concern him, Tatum explains Homicide looks out for each other before questioning if he has been at a desk too long. Cragen tells him he enforces the law riding any hump that breaks it. When Benson and Stabler join them in the squad room, Tatum asks if he is feeling wood for Andrews. Stabler responds telling him he is now calling him a cheap shot. Cragen tells Tatum to get out of his squad before he complains to his Lieutenant causing Tatum to explain that was who sent them. He asks again if Andrews is free to go. Cragen tells everyone he is. Stabler turns around telling Andrews he can go. As Andrews walks out, Munch and Tutuola escort Patricia into the squad room. Andrews informs them he wants her charged with Assault. Cragen tells Munch and Tutuola to do it. Patricia questions how he could charge her. Munch tells her he will ask him as they escort her away. Andrews tells the crew from Homicide to leave.Patricia enters the visitation room where Munch is waiting asking if he minds if she smokes. When she cannot find a light, she tells him she told Andrews she would quit so she might as well do it now. Munch informs her some habits are worse than others adding his wife has some pretty foul ones. He explains she will be his ex-wife soon. The only contact he has with her is when she is wanting money or for updates on status of the divorce. Patricia wonders if he hates his wife. He tells her that would make it too easy explaining that they still fight, but he is not around for the tantrums. She believes he treated her the way he did because of his wife. He corrects her saying he does not like her. When he asks how she is holding up, she informs him she is worried about Andrews. Munch is in awe at the generosity of women. She explains Andrews works midnights so he will not have to sleep. Once she saw Andrews scrubbing his bullets in the sink with his gun laid out on the counter on a towel. She asks him to check on Andrews for her when the guard returns to take her back to her cell.In court, Patricia's lawyer enters a plea of not guilty to the charge of Assault in the First Degree. Cabot asks for her to be released ROR. The judge believes her to be too generous even if she is feeling compassionate citing the fact Patricia threw a baton into a crowd of police officers and other city personnel. The judge orders a $10,000 bond. At One Police Plaza, Cragen is informed Jefferies has filed a discrimination lawsuit against the department. The papers were delivered earlier in the day. Legal is checking it for merit. When he is requested to speak with her unofficially, he explains he knew she was angry but did not know to what extent until now. When it is explained the suit does not name him but she wants back in the field, Cragen explains he has a problem with putting her back in the field. He is told to talk to her as a friend and if that does not work he is to make it go away.Munch walks into Cabot's office to inform her Andrews paid Patricia's bail so he believes she will recant. Cabot cannot wait to get Andrews on the stand. Munch thought she was dropping it, but is told she can sell it now. He had her arrested and bailed her out. That is suspicious. Munch tells her he did not know women got into whizzing contests. Cabot wants to speak with Patricia to clear the air.Cabot asks Patricia if anyone threatened her. She denies it saying she just does not want to go through with it anymore. She claims she does not want Andrews to go to jail over a petty marital spat. Munch reminds her she cried rape to anyone that would listen. She claims she was mad. Cabot asks if it has anything to do with Andrews dropping the Assault charge. Patricia tells her Andrews is a good guy when Cabot asks who paid her bail. When Munch reminds her Andrews raped her, she tells them he apologized. This was the first time he ever apologized. Cabot asks her to repeat what he said exactly. After she tells her what she wanted, Patricia explains she believes this is a fresh start for them. He is trying to feel her pain. Munch tells her she is psycho for counteracting his admission by dropping the charges. She refuses to lose Andrews because Munch decides to believe her now. After she leaves, Cabot informs Munch she can charge Patricia for Filing a False Report, but she wants to charge her for Felony Assault. Munch wonders if she just wants to put someone in jail. Cabot explains she wants to force Patricia's hand a little. Munch does not believe Andrews will re-file just to make her day. Cabot reminds him they will not need Andrews is there is another witness to the attack. Parker informs Munch he heard the Andrews fighting, but denies seeing anything. Munch reminds him the dispatcher was told it was assault with a deadly weapon so he had to have seen it. Parker verifies Andrews will not be told it was him before telling him he saw her cut Andrews with a knife. Patricia's lawyer believes Cabot is reaching by charging Patricia with Assault Two. Cabot informs him she has a witness, her prints, and the knife. She believes Patricia will get 3 years at Bedford Hills. Cabot informs them her compassion ended when the rape charge was dropped. She agrees to drop it to Assault Three if Patricia will testify in front of the Grand Jury so she can get an indicted on Andrews for First Degree Rape. When Patricia claims it is blackmail, Cabot corrects her saying it is the law.Benson and Stabler interrupt Tatum and Andrews at Manhattan South's Homicide unit. Stabler discreetly informs Andrews he has a warrant fo his arrest in his pocket. Stabler asks that he not force him to Mirandize and cuff him in front of his squad. Andrews removes his badge and weapon handing them to Tatum to hold. Tatum tries to stop them stating he thought it was over as he stands in their way. Benson asks him to move out of their way after telling him it is not settled. Benson and Stabler escort Andrews out of his precinct.As Cabot enters the courtroom, she notices the gallery is full of cops. Andrews is charged with Rape in the First Degree, Sexual Misconduct, and Sexual Abuse. When he pleads not guilty, Cabot asks for bail to be set at $50,000 causing the crowd to express their disapproval. Andrews's lawyer believes his client's reputation is being smeared. He reminds the court Andrews is a member of the NYPD and wants his day in court before requesting he be released ROR. Cabot believes if he is released ROR it will send a message that cops get a free ride. Cabot is told to save it for trial before he is released ROR. Her request for an order of protection for Patricia and for him to surrender all weapons is granted before court is dismissed. Cabot asks to speak with his lawyer. Cabot offers Sex Abuse One, a Class D Felony. She is turned down being told she would not give in if she thought she would win. When she claims she is trying to save time, she is reminded Patricia's recant will go on the record if she takes the stand as well as her physical attacks on Andrews. Cabot informs his lawyer that Andrews confessed a few days prior to his wife adding he does not deserve his freedom or a badge. She is told Spousal Privilege will stop the confession from getting into court. This trial will not be in front of a jury. The judge will render a verdict. Andrews's lawyer asks her to drop the charges and send the Andrews to counseling, but she refuses. When he tries to hand her a handkerchief for the egg on her face, she walks away.In court, Munch tells the court Patricia wanted to drop the rape charges against her husband, but never recanted her statement. He continues stating Patricia stated Andrews apologized for raping her for the first time in their marriage. When the defense objects claiming ""double hearsay,"" Cabot claims exception questioning why he would admit to guilt if he did not do it. The defense tries stating it falls under Spousal Privilege. Judge Beck informs them Privilege was voided by telling it to a third party. Patricia clarifies the pot she threw was from the stove, but it was no longer hot stating she did not want to hurt him. After hitting him with the pot, he grabbed her by the back of the head and dragged her into the house. They fought some more. She claims she would hit him and he would push her away. When she claims she does not know if she was raped, Cabot reminds her she stated he slammed her against the wall, put his arm around her neck, and squeezed causing her to almost lose consciousness. He pulled her pants down, removed her panties, and raped her. Patricia tells her she supposes she told that to the police before admitting that she did. The defense gets her to admit she went to the police to recant. She admits she was facing Assault charges and was offered a deal for her testimony. Cabot clarifies Patricia wanted to drop the charges only after Andrews dropped the charges against her. With the judge's help, Cabot gets her to admit she had a change of heart after having a long conversation with her husband. Andrews tells the court they have been married five years and have been mostly happy until recently. The police have been called four times to their home because his wife loses control. He claims he loves her and could not stand to see her locked up over something that is his fault due to his cheating and not coming home. He denies raping her or using excessive force on her. He believes she filed the charges because he failed to break up a year long affair as promised. He claims he apologized because his wife would not have let it go unless he did. He repeats that he loves her. Cabot asks if he told Patricia he could do her without leaving a mark. When he tries to deny he meant it the way it sounded, Cabot reminds him city personnel heard him. He explains the ""heifer"" threatened to torch him causing Cabot to question if he really loves the ""heifer.""  As Cabot is eating her lunch, Andrews's lawyer offers a plea to Sexual Misconduct and Andrews agrees to give up his badge. Cabot scoffs stating she may not have won yet, but she must have evened the odds considering he is trying to plead out. Andrews's lawyer asks her to make a deal with him and agree the two parties should never be married, especially to each other. He commends her on bringing up Andrews's statement in the heat of an argument. He wonders what people would say about his arguments with his wife. When he admits he wants to kill her sometimes, Cabot informs him that if she dies he will have a problem. She reminds him her offer of a D Felony with a sentence of 3 years is still on the table. He reminds her that with the charge Andrews will be tagged a sex offender for the rest of his life. Jefferies arrives at Cragen's office at his request. He asks her to sit down, but is told she would rather stand considering she doubts she will like what she is about to hear. He informs her he is talking to her unofficially so she sits down as requested. When Cragen states he knows the previous few months have been hard on her, she realizes the conversation is about her lawsuit. He wonders if she has thought about the politics and how hard the Department is going to make it for her. She does not believe her private life is any of the Department's business. Cragen reminds her SVU has different rules. She tells him she knows he ducked when it hit the fan. He informs her she is an integral part of his squad and although he did not agree with their conclusion, he did agree that she needs help. When she asks what her personal life has to do with the way she does her job or her ability to do it, he explains it is the equivalent of her eating her gun and he cannot allow that to happen. She concludes the meeting stating they do not have anything left to talk about before walking out.In court, Judge Beck states a wife has the right to the same protection against her husband as she would anyone else. He wonders how the law can determine if a rape occurred within a relationship defined by sexual intimacy. He does not believe it can absent any injuries. He finds Lloyd David Andrews not guilty of all three charges. As the court room is emptying, Andrews and Patricia hug. Munch approaches Cabot stating the case was a waste of time. Cabot does not agree reminding him she is the only ADA to get a case of Spousal Rape past the Grand Jury paving the way for someone else to get a conviction. Cragen walks into his office and sees a gun and badge laying on his desk with Tutuola occupying a chair next to it. Cragen assumes it is his and tells him he thought he would make it at least 60 days. Tutuola informs him Jefferies did not want to leave her gun unattended before apologizing and leaving. Alone in his office Cragen quietly says he is sorry as well."

Moments later McGee hears muffled screaming, and looks back to see a man forcing Tassler into a green 4x4. McGee runs up to them, but is forced to back off when the man points a gun in his face. When the man turns his attention back to Tassler, McGee grabs him and is joined by a bystander named Marty Potter. The man knocks both of them aside, jumps into the vehicle and speeds off with Tassler.Munch and Fin are called to the scene because the kidnapper dropped a chloroform-soaked cloth, the mark of the Bowery Stalker. The previous summer he kidnapped four women and drove away with them in a green 4x4. He raped, tortured and killed them in an abandoned warehouse in the city. The police raided the place and found the women's mutilated bodies after another victim, Sarah Kimmel, managed to escape from the warehouse after two days in captivity. They found partial fingerprints and some DNA, but couldn't match any of it to anyone in the system. The Stalker never returned there afterward, and SVU hadn't seen him again until now. He must have found a new safe house.When the gun was in his face, McGee saw a cat-shaped tattoo on the kidnapper's forearm. A parolee named Frank Taggart, who was convicted of assault, has that tattoo. He tells Munch and Fin where he had it done, and says he was at a bar when Tassler was kidnapped. Although Taggart left the bar in plenty of time to reach the scene, he doesn't own a 4x4. So Cragen has all the witnesses, including Sarah Kimmel, brought in for a line-up. Since her ordeal, Kimmel has been living on disability because she's too traumatized to leave home without falling apart. She keeps the lights on all the time, because in the darkness she'd see her tormentor's face again. At the line-up, McGee can't positively identify anyone. Potter identifies NYPD Officer Peters. Kimmel says her attacker isn't in the line-up. Taggart's not their man.Munch and Fin visit the tattoo shop that did Taggart's cat tattoo. The design was an original, brought in by another customer the previous summer. That customer said the cat was a platoon name in the service. He left the sketch behind, and the tattoo artist lets the detectives have it.The lab finds two sets of fingerprints on the paper, one belonging to the tattoo artist and the other to a ""John Doe."" The technician checked Doe's prints against other databases and identified Doe as Darryl Kern, a U.S. Army veteran. Kern was dishonorably discharged the previous year, at about the time the Stalker's attacks began. Motor Vehicle records show that he owns a green 4x4, and provide a home address.The police raid Kern's apartment. He's not there, but they find a Fort Dix military banner with a bobcat mascot, and his New York toll road E-Z Pass statements. The statements show road trips beginning at the same time as the Stalker's attacks. Kern traveled the same route each time, from the city to the small town of Walden Falls in upstate New York. Seven women went missing within a day of each trip.Munch and Fin make the long drive to Walden Falls. Local police chief Walker has never heard of Kern, so if he's there he's keeping a low profile. Officer Cheryl Baxter is assigned to help the detectives with their investigation. They begin with a visit to the local gas station, a regular stop on Kern's previous trips. The station owner recognizes Kern, and says that he spent a lot of time at the local gun shop. The gun shop owner identifies Kern as Arnold Cokely. He tells Munch and Fin that ""Cokely"" has a cabin somewhere north of town, well-stocked with provisions, guns and ammo. In fact, the real Arnold Cokely and his wife Amanda went missing in the city five months ago. Since Cokely's identification was used in a fraudulent firearms transaction, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) joins the case.Meanwhile, back in the city SVU goes through Kern's possessions and finds blueprints for a bomb shelter drawn by a contractor in Walden Falls. Munch asks Officer Baxter to have the contractor, McCartney, meet them at the police station. They arrive to find Chief Walker locking horns with ATF agent Gus Stone, arguing over who's in charge of going after Kern. Stone has a federal warrant for Kern's arrest. McCartney confirms he built a fortified underground bunker for Kern on some land about 10 miles north of town. The land already had a small cabin on it.The combined law enforcement forces raid Kern's cabin, and find it empty. Somebody must have tipped him off. Annie Tassler's mutilated body is in the bunker, and several other bodies are buried on the property. In the cabin is a pseudo-military operations manual of some sort, apparently forgotten by Kern in his haste to clear out. His last entry, dated the previous day, indicates he has an accomplice whom he's meeting back in the city.On the theory that Kern's accomplice is an Army buddy, Cragen arranges for Munch and Fin to visit Fort Dix. Colonel Marsden tells them that Kern had been a problem soldier who was under the delusion that the Army enjoyed killing. He spent so much time on kitchen duty, he was assigned there permanently. After he threatened someone with a kitchen knife, he was put in the brig. He was eventually diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and pronounced unfit for duty, resulting in his discharge. Kern had had one friend at Fort Dix, a man who made regular deliveries to the fort's mess hall. That man no longer delivers there, but Sergeant Pierre remembers the name of the company.The company owner identifies Kern's friend as Marvin Posey, who's currently out on National Guard reserve duty. He gives the detectives Posey's home address, but adds that Posey isn't there because he's in the wilderness practicing survival skills. Munch, Fin and a SWAT team go to Posey's house, where his elderly Aunt Mary readily answers the door. She tells them he'd been called away from home that morning.Aunt Mary, who's as overly trusting as she is kindhearted, assumes that Munch and Fin are friends of Posey's and invites them inside. She tells them her nephew is with the Green Berets, and shows them his scrapbook. In the book is a photo of Posey with Darryl Kern. Marvin Posey is Marty Potter, the good Samaritan at the Tassler kidnapping. Posey hadn't been trying to stop Kern; he'd been trying to get into the vehicle. No wonder he identified the wrong person in the line-up. And he must have tipped off Kern about the police.As Munch and Fin leave Posey's home, they receive word that Kern abandoned his 4x4 that morning in a shopping center outside Walden Falls. He carjacked a woman and child, and is now heading north toward Canada in their car. Back at SVU, the detectives determine that Kern and Posey have been exchanging cell phone calls at regular intervals since Tassler's kidnapping. The cell service provider determines that Posey eventually met up with Kern in Fisher's Landing, just inside the U.S. border. Munch and Fin join the New York state police and ATF in Fisher's Landing, where the carjacked vehicle and Posey's car were found parked in the driveway of a farmhouse. They raid the farm to find Posey dead, and the farmer's truck gone. Then they receive good news: Kern was arrested for shoplifting from an auto parts store in Ontario, after the farmer's truck broke down. The woman and child are safe, and the Ontario Provincial Police are holding Kern until Munch and Fin get there.Alex Cabot greets the detectives at the OPP station where Kern is being held. She has an extradition warrant for Kern, which of course he's fighting. Because a confession from Kern would strengthen New York's argument at the extradition hearing, Munch talks to Kern alone and tries to get one. Kern just laughs, because Canada won't extradite him for a capital crime unless New York waives the death penalty. Cabot confirms that's true, as of a Canadian Supreme Court decision the previous year.At the extradition hearing Canadian attorney Picard argues against extraditing Kern, based on the Canadian Supreme Court's unanimous decision regarding people facing death penalty charges. Cabot replies that the State of New York has amended its petition for extradition. The original petition sought to extradite Kern for murder with special circumstances attached and kidnapping, the former carrying the death penalty in New York. The amended petition reflects only one, lesser offense: possession of stolen property, the farmer's truck which Kern drove into Canada. Possession of stolen property valued at more than $5,000 is an extraditable offense under Canadian law. Since the amended petition requests Kern's extradition on a non-death penalty charge, the Canadian judge grants it.After Kern is returned to New York, Munch visits Sarah Kimmel. When she answers the door, he says, ""I just wanted to tell you. You can turn your lights out tonight."""

As they check, one of the doctors stumbles over three dead bodies tied together who aren't part of the experiment. SVU is called and Detective Stabler arrives on the scene. Upon questioning, Stabler finds out that the bodies were dragged to the area. IDs include an adult Hispanic female who had been a rape victim and whose case was previously handled by SVU. Detective Benson had been the primary investigator on the case. The white male was the father of a rape victim and had also been one of Detective Benson's cases. The minor's identity has yet to be determined.Back at the station house, Benson asked Stabler why she wasn't called since she had been the primary on all three cases. Arriving in the squad room, Benson relays to the squad the identifications of all three victims. Victim #1 was Peter Cordell, the father of a woman who had been raped and murdered. Benson handled his case, including driving him back and forth to court each day, and even held his hand when his daughter's killer, Victor Klaussen, was acquitted due a lab mix-up which contaminated the evidence. Victim #2 was Carmella Barrantes who had been raped and beaten three years ago by a gang banger currently serving 8 – 10 years in prison. Stabler offers that this clears the man as the murderer in this case, but Fin and Cragen consider the possibility of gang revenge although noting that there's no evidence of a gang-related link with the other two victims. Benson continues with victim #3 who was Clayton Derricks. The young boy had been physically abused by his father, Bruce Derricks. Clayton was removed from his home and placed in a group home where he was again sodomized by an older boy, then he was placed in foster care and Benson confesses how long it took for him to begin to trust her. Munch adds that the boy's foster mother had filed a missing person's report the previous day. He also adds that cause of death for all three victims was a combination of sedatives and potassium chloride which made for painless deaths. Cragen orders the squad to interview the families and find a common connection other than Benson.Benson and Stabler go to Adam Cordell's home and ask the young man if his father might have known Carmella Barrantes or Clayton Derricks. Adam says he never mentioned those names. He says Victor Klaussen killed his sister and probably killed his Dad. He said that Klaussen was laying carpet in Queens. He added Klaussen was married with a baby on the way. Benson asked Cordell if he had been stalking Klaussen. He replied that he hadn't, but his father used to follow him and tell everyone around him what kind of person Klaussen was and that probably got Peter Cordell killed. Benson and Stabler decide to pay a visit to Klaussen. They ask him to account for his movements, but he is not willing to comply. When he begins making backhanded remarks, Stabler throws him against his van and tells him they ought to arrest him for making threatening remarks. Klaussen says that two nights ago he was at home, and last night he and his wife were at Lamaze class.Mrs. Harding's Foster Home is the stop for Fin and Munch. Mrs. Harding said Clayton was pretty stable considering his circumstances, but he would occasionally run away. We he did run away, he went to see his friend Michael Washington at the group home in the Bronx. At the group home, the director said that Clayton and Michael bonded over their similar circumstances of abusive fathers. He also said that the psychologists thought it was better to move Clayton for his own well-being, and Mrs. Harding had called the home after Clayton went missing to see if he was there, but neither they nor Michael had seen Clayton in some time. When Fin and Munch talk to Michael directly, he admits that he did see Clayton the day before. Michael said that Clayton had received a letter that he had won a computer, but needed cab fare. Michael gave Clayton all he had - $22.00. Michael watched Clayton get in the cab from Starling Car Service to go and pick it up.At the Barrantes residence, Carmella's mother said that her daughter never went out after dark, but she was getting her life together and going back to school. She tells that her daughter was excited because she had received a letter saying she had won a computer in a raffle.Back at the squad room, Stabler says it didn't seem that any of the victims knew one another. Benson adds that, so far, they hadn't been able to track down Clayton's father. Fin says that they checked back and Peter Cordell had received a letter saying he had won a new computer just like Clayton had. Benson adds that Mrs. Barrantes said Carmella had received the same letter. Munch hangs up the phone and says that he talked to the cab company and got the address in Chelsea where the boy was dropped off. Benson says they're going to need a warrant.Detectives Benson, Stabler, Munch, and Fin go to the address, and the building owner meets them there. He says he never met the guy; the whole rental agreement was done by phone. He paid the owner six months rent in advance, and the owner left the key above the door since there was nothing to steal. ""AivilO Productions"" was in the business of designing promotional literature. A search of the office turns up several computer letters like the ones the victims received. Stabler notes the two glasses where he must have offered his victims a drink laced with valium or some other sedative. Benson closes the door and reveals the reverse of ""AivilO"" on the window portion of the door. From the backside it reads ""OliviA"".Back in the squad room, Huang briefs the detectives on the killer's profile. The three victims, being of different races, genders, and ages, indicate the perp was after revenge and the real target was Detective Benson. She has enraged the perp so much that he wants her twisting. The fact that the victims were placed in a federal facility indicates that he wanted attention for them. The perp used potassium chloride (as in a death row cocktail)  and posed the dead victims indicating he wanted them not to be any pain. Cragen puts Munch and Fin on the detail of checking Benson's old case files and seeing who might hold a grudge. Benson and Stabler are sent to follow the money trail. At the bank, they find out that the account was opened four months ago. Only photocopies are available of the checks so no fingerprints are available. The detectives ask the bank to not physically handle any checks that come through on that account so that prints can be checked. As they exit the bank, Benson is disgruntled that the FBI will be handling the prints. Stabler says they're just better equipped and quicker. Benson gets a phone call that Clayton's father, Bruce Derricks, has been arrested on a drunk and disorderly charge. At the jail, they interview the man to see if he has had any recent contact with his son or anyone asking about him. He turned on the detectives, saying it was their fault he was taken and raped in the group home. He gives no further information. After the detectives leave, Stabler expresses concern for Benson's safety. Benson replies that if he had wanted to take her out, he would have already done so. The detectives continue to interview parolees that may have had a grudge against Benson, but they continue to come up with no solid leads. Benson and Stabler next travel to the flower shop of Eric Plummer's ex-wife. As it turns out, the innocent Eric Plummer spent 7 years in prison for attempted murder and rape. DNA evidence not available at the time cleared him. Ms. Plummer says she doesn't know where her ex-husband is and wouldn't tell the detectives if she did. As they leave, Stabler invites Benson over for dinner. Benson declines.As Benson sleeps, the buzzer to her apartment is rung. She answers, but no one replies. Then it rings again without stopping. Benson grabs her gun, goes down stairs, and finds the buzzer has been purposely jammed. In front of the building, in a box marked ""From AivilO Productions"", is the dead body of Clayton's father, Bruce Derricks. Unlike the other victims, Bruce Derricks had suffered in death. FBI agents question whether Benson has seen or heard anything. Then he tells Benson that Derricks was alive until she went to talk to him. He concludes that Benson needs police protection because she is being stalked. Benson says she doesn't work for him and asks who bailed Derricks out from jail. The agent says that according to police forms, it was her. Benson and Stabler go to the Lonnie's Bail Bonds office and ask to see the paperwork on Bruce Derricks. Lonnie said the guy by the name of Oliver Benson paid cash, so he didn't take an ID. Uncooperative as he is, Benson and Stabler start moving people out of the office. Lonnie then gives a vague description of what he remembers about the guy.Cragen is strong-armed by the FBI to put Benson on desk duty, but he doesn't relent. He comes out to ask the squad if there are any leads. Stabler comes up with a lead – a 45 minute call from Plummer to a Baseline Labs in Midtown. Fin adds if Plummer works for the lab, he'd have access to potassium chloride. Munch says the autopsy report on Derrick reveals that he suffered. He was awake and aware, but paralyzed when he was suffocated. Benson says that the killer saw Derricks as a perp and killed him like one. Cragen orders Benson and Stabler to the lab to check out employees. Cragen tells Benson he's worried about her safety. Benson says ""no protective detail. She says this perp doesn't want her dead; he wants her twisting and obsessing about what's going on.At Baseline Labs, the director says he doesn't have an Eric Plummer working for him. When they show him Plummer's mug shot, he says that it looks like Norman Webber. He works for their insurance sector collecting blood and urine samples from clients for physicals. Benson asks to see his personnel file. The man is flustered and offers that their company has a rigorous screening process. If this man is a criminal, they could be in big trouble for hiring him in the first place. Stabler says the man is not an ex-con, but needs to call them as soon as possible.Back at the station, Benson steps into Huang's office. Benson says that the perp hates her and is killing the people she tried to help. Huang shares that one time while working an FBI case, he misinterpreted the amount of time it would take for a perp to try to kill him before the guards could get there. Benson understands – the perp got in his head just like this one is in hers. Huang says this perp is enacting psychological warfare. The fact that he had posed the bodies in a comforting position and used potassium chloride so that they would suffer painless deaths indicates that the perp, in his own mind, is freeing them from the miserable existence he must feel that Benson left them in. Somehow he identifies with the victims and sees himself as a victim, too.Back in the main squad room Plummer arrives with his attorney. Novak tells the two that this is simply an ongoing investigation, and when they clear him, Mr. Plummer can put this behind him. The attorney says he must insist on Benson's absence from the meeting. Benson says that's not a problem, she was leaving anyway. Munch tells Benson that they're heading to Chauncey's (bar). Plummer's attorney says that his client has already been wrongly convicted and spent seven years falsely imprisoned. Stabler says those seven years must have given him plenty of time to plan his revenge. Novak tells Plummer he wasn't personally sent there by Benson. He had been convicted by a jury in a fair trial. Plummer turns to Novak and asks if she's ever been to prison – arrested, cuffed, fingerprinted, beaten, raped, and tortured. If not, then don't dismiss his feelings. Stabler asks Plummer why he changed his name to Norman. Plummer says he wanted a fresh start.  Stabler then asks what drugs he had access to including potassium chloride. Plummer says he doesn't even know what that is. The attorney presents Plummer's work records for the last two evenings and says that he doesn't have an alibi for his evenings because he lives alone, but this time circumstantial evidence won't cut it. The two leave. Novak says he's right. If they want to get a conviction for this, they're going to have to prove he had the syringe in his hand. Stabler says he thinks Plummer is the guy. Cragen agrees. He tells Stabler to follow up on Plummer's seven years in prison. He had to have made a friend there.At the bar, Munch tries to convince Benson it wasn't her fault that Plummer went down. A witness picked him out of a lineup. Fin adds that the guy couldn't provide an alibi. Benson asks him to remember where he was at a specific time a couple of weeks ago and his inability to do so proves her point that sometimes it's hard to remember your exact whereabouts for a given time. Benson says that it was her evidence that helped put him away on such a weak case, and even one wrongfully imprisoned man is too many. She goes on to point out that Plummer was a victim. Munch says if he's the right guy, he's a predator, not a victim.  Benson calls it a night and leaves the bar. As she walks down the street, she is aware of a man following her. She pulls her gun and turns on him. The man says he's FBI. While Benson has him pinned and looking for ID, she spots Plummer walking down the opposite side of the street observing her. She turns to go after Plummer when a second FBI man stops her. She asks who they are and why they are following her. They admit that they are protective detail requested by Detective Stabler. Benson goes straight to Stabler's house and tells him that ""only the rat squad puts cops on other cops without telling them"" and she deserves better than that. She ends the conversation with the statement, ""When you can't trust your partner, Elliot, it's time to get a new one.""The next day, Benson is in Novak's office. Benson tells Novak that warrants have been issued in the past for less, why not now? Novak replies that once a judge knows of Plummer's wrongful conviction, that judge is going to bend over backwards for him. Benson says she saw Plummer and knows he is stalking her. Novak asks how Plummer could have known where she was. Benson says he must have overheard them in the squad room. Novak counters by asking how many businesses were in the area because any decent defense attorney will say he was just running errands. Benson argues that he has killed four people and they aren't doing anything about it. Novak looks at Benson and asks how many drinks she had that night. Benson is clearly irritated with this question. Novak continues that since the system made a mistake before, everything they do is under a microscope. Benson stares at Novak and says, ""I wasn't drunk."" She storms out of Novak's office and goes to Cragen's office asking for permission to take the vacation time she has coming because she knows she's too close to the case. Cragen offers that no one is questioning her ability. Benson says, ""I am."" In the central squad room, Cragen asks Stabler, Fin, and Munch if they've followed up on information about Plummer in prison. Munch says Plummer corresponded with his wife almost daily, even after their divorce. Stabler asks who his cell-mate was. Fin says it was a murderer by the name of Russell Williams who was parolled in 2000, but is currently at Riker's awaiting trial in another murder case. Cragen says Williams is going to want to cut a deal but if the prosecution has a good case, they're not going to want to cut him any slack. Novak goes to the ADA in charge of Williams' case. The ADA says no deal. Novak asks if they want her to show the rotting corpse of a ten year-old boy. The ADA argues that this time they could put him away for good. Novak asks them to go for twelve and a half to twenty-five if they can get information to put Plummer away. He agrees.At Riker's, Williams says that Plummer had it in for some female cop. The two ADAs say they need proof. Williams says he handed over several letters to his old lady from Plummer to give to Plummer's wife. Williams further adds that if he spilled his guts to his cell-mate, imagine what must be in the letters to Plummer's wife.  The detectives carry out the warrant they have for Plummer's apartment. Fin finds a loose tile and pries it up to find a box containing vials of potassium chloride. Stabler says it's time to pick up Plummer. He heads to the lab to ask if Plummer is working that day. The irritated boss says that this is harassment. He knows of the story where Norman (Plummer) was wrongfully convicted. He tells Stabler that his partner has already been in threatening obstruction and he gave her the address just so she'd leave. Stabler asks what the address is. Benson enters an apartment building, and almost immediately hears shots fired within the first apartment. She calls for backup. A woman opens the door. Plummer is out of the doorframe, but has a gun pointed at her head. Crying, the woman says that he knew she was coming. She says that Plummer is going to kill her. Benson says it won't. The woman says that Plummer wants her to tell Benson that they were suffering and he only helped alleviate the misery Benson had put them in. The woman says Plummer wants her to come in. When Benson says she can't, Plummer pulls the crying woman into another room. Benson yells that she's coming in. With gun drawn, she enters the room where Plummer has the gun drawn on the woman. Benson says to let the woman go because this is between the two of them. Plummer asks Benson how it feels to have your credibility shot and your life in ruins. Benson replies, ""It sucks."" Plummer says he was innocent. Benson agrees, but adds that now he has killed four innocent people. Plummer says it was three innocent people and one child molester. Benson offers to testify on his behalf in court that she was responsible. Plummer says there's not going to be a trial. Benson keeps her gun pointed on Plummer and tells him not to think she won't shoot him. Plummer says he's counting on it. He pushes the woman down and the gun harder against her head. Benson tells him to drop his weapon. Plummer says there are no bullets in his gun and then makes to shoot his victim, but Benson fires at Plummer, killing him instantly. The entry squad and detectives arrive on the scene immediately after. While Stabler takes the gun from Benson's hand, the first entry cop checks Plummer's gun and reveals that it wasn't loaded. The grief-stricken Benson is speechless. Stabler offers to drive her home, but Benson says she has to give her statement. Stabler says he'll take her, but Benson tells him to stay away from her.Back in Benson's apartment, she is sitting in the dark as the rain falls outside the windows. As tears roll down her cheeks, she ignores both the knocking at the door and the ringing phone. In the hallway, Stabler looks at the door, closes his cell phone, and walks away."

The friends are surprised to find the couple in the dining room. Max is dead, gagged and bound to a chair with duct tape. Peyton, who's been raped, is gagged and tied to a table.Warner determines that Max was pistol-whipped to death. She also finds animal hairs, from either a dog or a cat, in the adhesive from the duct tape used to bind him. A surgical scar on his chest indicates that Max had had heart surgery within the past year.At the hospital, Peyton tells Elliot and Olivia that they never left for the restaurant. Max had insisted on taking out the garbage first, and returned with a masked gunman. The gunman tossed Peyton a roll of duct tape and forced her to bind and gag Max. He then tied her to the table, and spent the next two hours alternately raping her and beating her husband until Max was dead. Elliot tells Peyton that a lockbox in the bedroom was broken into. Peyton says it had contained $10,000 to $15,000 in cash, and her grandmother's jewelry.The Klebergs' apartment doorman tells Munch and Fin that several months ago, a very agitated man came to see Max. The man said that Max, a physician, was ""a mad scientist [who] ruined his life."" Max nervously told the doorman to call the police if the man didn't leave.Elliot and Olivia visit Dr. Carr, chief of urology at the hospital where Max practiced. While waiting to see Carr, they talk with his secretary, Lara Todd. She tells them about a disgruntled patient from one of Max's research trials on impotency, and offers to look up his file.Carr tells the detectives that Max had been better than new after his heart bypass surgery six months ago.Peyton had devotedly nursed her husband back to health. As a urologist, Max had specialized in sexual dysfunctions. At the time of his death, he had been testing a new impotency cream. However, Carr declines to comment on the patient Lara mentioned.  As Elliot and Olivia leave, Lara gives them a copy of the patient's file.Martin Welker had abruptly quit Max's research trial after Brooklyn SVU arrested him for attempted rape. Welker denies both killing Max and raping Peyton. He tells Munch and Fin that Max didn't tell him about the side effects of the impotency cream. At Welker's trial Max testified that Welker's own violent tendencies, not the cream, had caused the sexual assault. Welker had sued the hospital and the pharmaceutical company, but not Max because the doctor had no money to his name.Max's accountant tells Munch and Fin that because of Max's heart condition, no malpractice insurer would cover him. To continue practicing medicine, at the accountant's advice Max shielded his financial assets by moving everything into Peyton's name. Asked if anyone else could be after those assets, the accountant replies that Max recently had trouble with Jesse, his son from his first marriage. Max had cut off Jesse's trust fund after catching the young man in his apartment, trying to steal Peyton's jewelry.Jesse, who has a serious gambling problem, is brought in for questioning. He says he became a gambler because his mother and Peyton are both ""charity junkies"",  and the biggest fundraiser for any charity is casino night. He admits having tried to steal his stepmother's jewelry because he was in major debt to his bookie. Neither his father nor his stepfather would help him because they believed he was involved in drugs. However, he denies the rape and the murder.Jesse's mother, Marilyn Dunlap, arrives at SVU with a lawyer. Both she and Jesse resented Max, who deserted them after she put Max through medical school. Nevertheless, Dunlap insists that Jesse had nothing to do with the crimes. If anyone in this case is resentful, it's Peyton. After recovering from his bypass surgery, the revitalized Max ""had been nailing just about anything that moved."" Peyton has known about her husband's chasing since at least the previous month, because Dunlap told her when they happened to meet at a fundraiser. Dunlap knows for a fact that one of Max's paramours had been Lara Todd.Lara admits to having had a fling with Max, but says it ended months ago. Elliot and Olivia tell her that DNA testing has cleared Martin Wexler. Asked whom Max pursued after her, Lara points them to Judy Trahill in the hospital's radiology department. Trahill says Peyton had ""cared too much"" about Max during his recovery. She did everything for him, which made him feel like an invalid. After Trahill, Max targeted another nurse at the hospital.  However, that time Peyton unexpectedly visited, caught him in the act, and slapped the nurse. Jesse Kleberg volunteers a DNA sample, and is cleared. Max's cell phone records indicate 1,000 minutes of calls during the last month, all to Lara Todd. Elliot and Olivia go to her apartment, where they find her gagged and tied to her bed. She's been raped and beaten.Lara says she lied about when her affair with Max ended, to keep it out of the news reports of his death. Peyton hadn't known about their affair till the very end. Three days before Max's murder, Peyton came to Lara's apartment and threatened to ruin both their lives if Lara didn't stop seeing Max. Cat hairs, most likely from a tabby, are found in Lara's bedroom. SVU now wonders if Peyton, the wronged wife, might have staged the crimes at her home to punish Max for his philandering. None of Peyton's missing jewelry has turned up at the pawnshops. Suspecting insurance fraud, Cragen has Cabot obtain Max's financial records for evidence to justify a search warrant for Peyton's apartment.A bank official, who knows Peyton socially as well as professionally, tells Munch and Fin that Peyton had taken some of her jewelry from her safe deposit box shortly before Max's murder. Bank records show that eight days before the murder, Peyton had also taken out $10,000 in cash. For a hit man, perhaps?A search of Peyton's apartment turns up the jewelry, inside a cigar box. Peyton says she can't explain how the jewelry got into the box. She admits that she took out the $10,000 in cash to pay a private investigator, which was how she found out about Lara. Munch and Fin catch up with the investigator, who has only pet dogs and doesn't eliminate husbands. He gives them copies of the photos he took of Max and Lara. The same man appears in the background of two of the photos, as if he were stalking Max. Lara identifies the man as her downstairs neighbor, Vincent. Elliot and Olivia visit him, and find that he has a tabby cat. He refuses to talk to them.Vincent has a criminal record for robbery and assault. Peyton and Lara's rape kits show that the same man attacked both women. Each person in this tangled web has connections to some, but not all three, of the others. The only thing connecting all four of them is the tabby cat hairs found at both Peyton's and Lara's rape scenes.  And Vincent has a tabby.While Munch and Fin search Vincent's apartment for the cat, Elliot and Olivia check in on Lara. She has fresh bruises on her face, but she refuses to tell them what happened. She does let Olivia take her to a women's shelter for her own safety.The lab confirms that the cat hairs from both rape scenes came from Vincent's pet. When Elliot and Olivia go to his apartment to arrest him, Lara is standing over his dead body and holding his gun. At SVU's office, she tells them she told Vincent two years ago that she wanted to be only friends. But he was so persistent and sweet, he finally wore her down. Afterward he became possessive and violent, in classic abusive relationship form. Meeting Max had given Lara the strength to finally say no to Vincent. Max had been about to leave Peyton, after which he and Lara were going to move in together. Then one night, Vincent told Lara that Max was dead. She was in his apartment because he had located her at the shelter and forced her to return with him . He tried to rape her again, and she managed to reach his gun and shoot him.Since Vincent killed Lara's lover, a jury could interpret Lara's killing of Vincent as an act of  revenge. The lab confirms that Vincent's gun was used to kill Max, and that Vincent raped both Peyton and Lara. Huang argues that Lara is a classic domestic abuse victim. Cabot is unwilling to close the case without pressing charges, absent clear evidence that Lara had acted in self-defense. Munch and Fin return to Vincent's apartment to search for evidence supporting ""a case against Vincent that would put him away for life if he weren't already dead.""Later in her office, Cabot has Lara sign her police statement. Cabot then plays a videotape, in which Lara offers Vincent $15,000 to kill Peyton Kleberg. The only relationship between Lara and Vincent had been in Vincent's own unstable mind. Still, Lara made use of Vincent's obsession with her to hire him to kill Peyton. Realizing that Max and Lara wanted to be together, Vincent killed Max instead. However, eliminating Peyton had been Max's idea in the first place. Lara says, ""Where do you think I got the $15,000? And who do you think hid the jewelry?""A stunned Peyton says that while Max had changed after his heart attack, their marriage had finally been returning to normal. He had stopped seeing Lara after Peyton found out about the affair. Surely that was why Lara had Max killed, when he didn't leave his wife for her after all. Olivia regretfully tells Peyton that Max had planned the whole thing.  Peyton says, ""That doesn't make any sense. Why would Max set up his own death?"" Elliot quietly replies, ""He wasn't supposed to die. You were."""

Soft music is playing and candlelight is glowing in the bedroom. Andrew peers through the door and sees Sydney dressed in a satin teddy, kneeling on the bed. When he enters the room, he finds she's been hanged from the ceiling fan.Warner is away at a conference, so Assistant Medical Examiner Justin comes to the scene. To him it's a textbook case of accidental death by autoerotic asphyxiation, though he still has to perform an autopsy. Andrew Green tells Olivia and Elliot that Sydney wasn't an autoerotic or anything of the sort. They had separated two weeks ago after a stormy six months of marriage. The visitor log at Sydney's building indicates that around lunchtime the day of her death, she had two other visitors: Pam Adler and Amelia Chase. Adler, a prominent criminal defense attorney, tells Olivia and Elliot that she and Chase had a lunch date with Sydney that day. When Sydney didn't show, they went to her apartment. Sydney was depressed about her marital problems, and told them she wanted to be alone.  Eventually Adler asks if the detectives suspect foul play. Elliot replies that until the cause of death is determined, the law requires them to treat the matter as a homicide. Adler scoffs, ""What you know about the law I could fit in the palm of my hand.""Amelia Chase, a day trader, tells Munch and Fin that she and Sydney met at Goldman Sachs.  They became friends because there were few women in their business. Both of them enjoyed making money in the stock market, and upstaging men while they were at it. Chase paints Sydney as a big risk-taker and a sexual adventuress who was particularly into choking herself.A check into the Greens' finances reveals both Andrew and Sydney were broke. However, thanks to life insurance Andrew will inherit about $50,000 in cash.  Because of a premarital agreement, he would have received zero in a divorce.  Andrew admits that he and Sydney met not on a vacation as they'd told everyone, but in drug rehab for addiction to painkillers. They'd been fighting because Sydney had been using drugs again, and during her bachelorette party she and some friends raped a male stripper. The police had been called, because they were waiting on the doorstep when Andrew and Sydney returned from their honeymoon.  Olivia and Elliot catch up with the stripper, Peter Smith. He asks if they've gotten the names of the other women who raped him. When they tell him Sydney Green's dead, he denies killing her. His alibi for that day is confirmed.  Assistant ME Justin officially rules Sydney's death accidental. However, SVU still has an open rape case:  Peter Smith. Elliot doesn't believe Smith's story, but Olivia and Alex Cabot do.  Alex tells the detectives that in January, the law defining first-degree rape had been changed to include attacks by women on men. At Alex's order they interview Smith, who with great difficulty describes the attack by Sydney and two unidentified friends. When he threatened to call the police, one of the friends said,  ""What you know about the law wouldn't fit in the palm of my hand.""Smith identifies Adler and Chase in line-ups. Adler readily meets with reporters and says Smith is ""a venal [susceptible to bribery]  young man who wants to be famous."" Adler's defense attorney, Carolyn Maddox, asks the judge to dismiss the rape charge because the law is unconstitutional. The violation of rape occurs through penetration, and women aren't anatomically equipped to penetrate men. Therefore, women can't be equal to men under this law. The judge replies that the First Amendment doesn't provide for selective equality. Either women are equal to men, or they aren't. She refuses to dismiss the charges, and the trial is on.At the trial, Pam Adler steps forward when it's the defense's turn to cross-examine Peter Smith. The judge  shares the prosecution's outrage, but legally she can't block attorney Adler from conducting her own defense. Adler asks Smith: Did you file a civil lawsuit for $5 million against Sydney Green?  He is forced to answer yes. Adler presents a copy of the suit to the court, and asks that the rape charge be dismissed.The prosecution team scrambles for damage control. Smith hadn't mentioned the civil suit because it would have given non-believing Elliot a perfect reason to drop his case. Since the police wouldn't help him, Smith had sued Sydney to get the names of her two partners in crime. The tactic had worked: Sydney had called Smith's attorney the day before her death, to set up a meeting. Andrew Green didn't know about the suit, which was erased from the court's records after Sydney's death ended the matter. Therefore, Adler had to have obtained a copy while Sydney was still alive. But how did she know it even existed? Answer: Sydney told her and Amelia Chase about it, and that she was giving in to Smith's demand.  Olivia and Elliot revisit Sydney's death with Warner, who sees beyond the obvious and immediately recognizes it was no accident. Sydney hadn't had a towel or silk scarf, to keep the rope from chafing her  neck. Some chokers don't use a buffer, and wear turtlenecks or scarves to hide the rope mark.  The ropes were tied correctly, so a practicing autoerotic staged the bedroom scene.The three of them go to Sydney's apartment and re-enact the killing, during which Olivia stands on the bed to reach the ceiling fan. When she instinctively places her hands on the ceiling to steady herself, she and Elliot remember that CSU had checked only the area immediately around the fan for fingerprints.Amelia Chase constantly wears turtlenecks and scarves. The police find her fingerprints on Sydney's bedroom ceiling, and autoerotic paraphernalia in her apartment. Chase accepts a deal to testify against Adler, but Maddox cleverly turns Chase's testimony to Adler's advantage. The jury convicts Adler of only one charge out of four, third-degree assault. As Adler and Maddox exit the courtroom to the clamor of reporters, they're also greeted by Olivia and Elliot who immediately arrest Adler for the murder of Sydney Green."

Olivia arrives at the scene all dressed up and angry for having to leave in the middle of her date. Fin is already there and gives her the info he has. They pop the trunk of her car and find boxes of a very expensive new cancer medicine called Rytex.The victim, Paula Grey worked in a pharmaceutical company, but they are not the one that makes the Rytex, so they have no idea what she was doing with the drugs and how she got them.  The police lab analyses the drugs in the trunk and turns out they were placeboes. The police suspects she was selling fake drugs to make their makers look bad and the drugs from her company sell better. Munch fids out that she was tipping the FBI about what her company was doing, and they suspect that maybe that's what got her killed. They bring her boss in for questioning, he was paying for her apartment and her car, and had all the motives to kill her.Meanwhile another victim fitting the same MO is found, still alive, so they go to interview her. She says it was a Cop who raped her, he pulled her over and made her get out of the car to take a breathalyzer and told her he wouldn't fine her if she had sex with him. When she refused, he raped her and kept her driver's license.Fin suspects she is lying to get out of a DUI and Olivia gets worked up by his suspicions. CSU tells them that the fibers under the victim's fingernails were the same as police uniforms. Olivia and Fin investigate which officers were around that area and find that two cops were over there and were unaccounted for at the time of both rapes. Fin still doesn't believe any cop could've done this.Cap. Craigen calls IAB and finds out they're investigating one of the cops, Marcosi, for a Year, for having sex with a prostitute in exchange of letting her of the hook. Olivia an Finn search Marcosi's locker and his police car, but the car was cleaned and the tires were changed. Marcosi is arrested.While Olivia and Finn are questioning Marcosi, another victim comes forward after seeing the case on the news. She was raped six weeks ago, but was afraid of reporting a cop. They investigate and find Marcosi had an alibi for this rape. Marcosi claims he's innocent and they can put him in a line up.Olivia and Finn go get Francesca, the second victim, for the line up but when they get to her house the neighbors say another police officer already took her, so Marcosi is of the hook. They come to the conclusion that it is a cop impersonator. They find a suspect and get a warrant to search his house, the search is frustrated and they only find some blood in his bed.ADA Cabbot, sends Olivia and Finn to arrest him in his work, but they decide to follow him around to find out where he hid Francesca. They follow him to a bar and talk about the rapes to try to make him nervous. He bites the bait and goes to where he hid Francesca, with Olivia and Finn right behind him. They arrest him and save Francesca's life. In the wall they find dozens of woman's drivers licenses.

The inmate taunts Elliot and Huang. He begins to describe how he killed a girl his 'first time'. Huang says the interview is over and presses an alarm. The inmate says ""relax chief, the guards are changing shift"". Huang yells at Elliot to get up from the table just before the inmate overturns it. He then seizes Huang and bangs his head against a wall, his hands around Huang's throat. Elliot attempts to pull the inmate off Huang. Huang slides down the wall, unconscious, while Elliot fights the inmate.Three days until execution: Allan and Hannah Cooper, whose daughter Debbie was murdered 11 years earlier, visit Stabler (who worked on the case previously) at the precinct and tell him they know who murdered their daughter. A death-row signature killer Matthew Brodus mentioned Our Lady of Light, Debbie's old school, in a television interview. Cragen, Stabler and Huang compare Brodus' previous murders and they match, despite the fact that Debbie was blinded by her killer, leading them to think Debbie knew him. Stabler reveals his ex-partner ""put a slug through his jaw"" over this case.Stabler and Munch go to Debbie's old school. The principal tells them they had a boiler system was replaced around the time of Debbie's death (Brodus was a plumber).  They go to the business that did the job but the boss says Matthew Brodus never worked there. Stabler and Huang interview one of Brodus' ex-cellmates, but leave when he wants a deal. Stabler and Huang argue about the best way to get information, Huang saying no deals. Alex talks to the ADA in New Jersey and tries to get the interview, but is denied. Despite what Huang thinks, Stabler asks Alex to offer a deal to the ex-cellmate.Two days until execution: The ex-cellmate asks Elliot to call his daughter or else he won't give Elliot any information about Brodus. He rings, but the woman on the other end of the line hangs up. Elliot goes to see Huang and admits that the cell-mate only told him things he'd read in the newspaper or seen on TV. Huang muses that one day Elliot will see that he knows what he is doing. Two detectives from Brooklyn SVU arrive and say that the call Elliot made was actually to a rape victim. Cragen reprimands him but smooths it over. Munch tries to find one of Debbie's teachers, Vivien Parrish, who dated Brodus.Elliot goes to see the other ex-cellmate, who doesn't want to speak because he is now religious. Elliot visits the father of boy who the cellmate killed in order to get answers. The cellmate tells Elliot what he knows about Brodus, saying he thought he was smarter than everyone. He revealed that Brodus blinded and killed a girl close to home. One day before execution, Cabot makes an appeal to get an interview; the New Jersey ADA allows it as long as they don't prosecute, no matter what Brodus reveals.Four hours before the execution, Huang is prepping Elliot for the interview, warning him about Brodus. In the interview, Elliot asks about Debbie's high school, but does not mention her name. He questions Brodus about Vivien Parris, and makes a comment about Brodus' mother and how she abandoned Brodus. He angers Brodus by saying Vivien Parish mentioned Brodus' 'shortcomings'. While Brodus rants about Vivien, he accidentally says 'Debbie' instead. He realises his mistake, but says to Elliot ""you're not as smart as you think you are.""Cabot and the New Jersey ADA arrive at the prison. The alarm sounds because Brodus is attacking Elliot and Huang. The guards run in and pull Brodus off, but one of the guards hits him several times and knocks him out. The execution cannot go ahead because he is in a coma, and they can't execute and unhealthy man. Elliot says he will break the news to the rest of the victims' families, but at least they got a confession about Debbie. The ADA says ""They won't care. Would you?"" As Elliot leaves the prison through a large group of death penalty protesters, he spots Debbie's parents and goes over to give them closure."

He convinces Olivia to help him find who the girl is to try to convince her to report the rape. They find the name of the girl and convince the Captain to let them open an investigation and talk to the girl.Olivia and Elliot go to the school to talk with Cynthia Wilmont, the raped girl, but she is really scared that her parents would find out about it and refuses to say anything. They try to assure her that her parents wouldn't know but she doesn't believe them, since the nurse that examined her was the only one that knew and the nurse promised her nobody would know.A few hours later they are called to the hospital, Cynthia was admitted after being tossed through a flight of stairs. She claims she fell, but her injuries aren't consistent with a fall. Olivia and Elliot talk to her parents, but don't tell them yet about the rape. Olivia suspects that maybe Cynthia made the rape story up to cover sexual activity from her parents. They go talk to Cynthia's best friend to find out how much she knows about all this. Amy tells them that they have a ""club"", Cynthia's boyfriend and his friends supply the girls with beer in exchange of sexual favors, like oral sex. She tell them that they fooled around but never went ""all the way"".

The doorman of the building gives the police the name of a security technician that was in her apartment at that time. The manager of the security tech company tells Elliot that Ray Campbell, the man he's looking for is a model employee, and has been working for him a long time.

As they talk, the boy asks what to say to his mother- she suspects something happened between them. Meanwhile, the SVU team is listening to the conversation. But before the man can say anything incriminating, the boy warns him and tells him to run. Elliot, Fin and Olivia run after the man and Fin catches him running out of the station. Even though they don't have anything incriminating  caught on tape, they arrest the suspect.When Olivia and Elliot interview Roy Barnett, he claims that Sam is lying about being molested because he is a troubled kid. Olivia says it's funny how he seems to meet a lot of troubled kids [that lie about being molested by him]. He had two previous arrests with the same charges, and pled guilty to coercion and endangering the welfare of a child. He claims it is all a misunderstanding. Alex is frustrated they didn't get the incriminating tape, and is puzzled as to why Sam warned him instead of letting him incriminate himself. Dr. Huang explains that is common for most victims of long term abuse to care about their abusers;  they then have a hard time reporting them or testifying against them. He says that Alex should talk to Sam again and try to convince him to testify in court. She talks to him and asserts him that it's not his fault about warning Mr. Barnett. She tries to make him feel better about the whole thing, but he ends up thinking she implied he was gay and storms out.Alex, Dr. Huang, Elliot and Olivia try to reason with his mother, and have her convince Sam to testify. But she won't force him to do anything he doesn't want to. They only have a few hours to make the case against Barnett without Sam, but they have no other evidence. Alex gets a warrant for Barnett's apartment and the team searches it. They find a large amount of adult porn, but nothing of children, and nothing illegal.Munch and Fin talk to Barnett's parole officer and he tells them he doesn't believe he will ever stop. Barnett once admitted to him that he molested over a hundred boys. Alex's boss pressures her and tells her without Sam's testimony they don't have a case. At her urging, Alex talks to his mother and pleads for her not to let the man who ruined her son's life walk away free. Sam agrees to testify.Elliot waits with Sam at the court house and reassures him that he still gets nervous before testifying despite his experience. This helps to calm Sam before he testifies. Afterward, Sam is walking out of the courtroom with Alex and Elliot and they bump into Barnett. This makes Sam gets nervous. Suddenly a man comes charging against Barnett, knocking Alex on the floor. He is arrested for assault. He gives a statement to Olivia and Elliot and tells them he was molested for 5 years by Roy Barnett when he coached his team. Barnett stopped molesting him when he got older, starting on his younger friends. Olivia and Elliot ask for the names of other boys Barnett might have molested.Alex prepares Sam for the trial and asks if he knows about any other boys he might have molested. Sam remembers some good moments with Roy Barnett, before the abuse started. Alex explains it is what child molesters do, they make their victim like and trust them before starting the abuse. It saddens Sam to know Barnett never truly cared for him. Later that night, Alex gets word that Sam tried to kill himself. At the hospital his mother lashes out at Alex, blaming her for what happened to her son. Sam may never wake up, and may have severe brain damage if he does. Barnett's lawyer files a motion to dismiss, but the judge gives Alex three days to make a case against Roy Barnett.The team finds another victim of Roy Barnett and go to talk to him. But he is a convicted pedophile and doesn't make for a good witness. He does tell them Barnett used to send his victims videotapes of their sexual acts, and that they should search Sam's house. They talk to Mrs. Cavanaughm, but she refuses to let them search her house. Tempers flare and Alex argues with Captain Cragen and the detectives. She fears she has no choice but to let the case be dismissed.Later, Alex calls Elliot and Olivia to search the Cavanaughs' house. They find the videotapes hidden in Sam's closet. They arrest Barnett just as he is moving out of his apartment. As they are leaving the station to celebrate, Olivia and Elliot are scolded by Captain Cragen for making an illegal search. They claim they didn't know Alex didn't have a warrant. Even though the search was not permitted by Mrs. Cavanaugh, the judge does not suppress the video evidence. Barnett's lawyer brings it up, and he has no jurisdiction to do so- Mrs. Cavanaugh's rights were violated, not Barnett's.Roy Barnett is indicted on six counts:  sexual abuse in the second degree, sodomy in the second degree, use of a child in a sexual performance, promoting obscene sexual performance by a child, possessing obscene sexual performance by a child. Alex is suspended for her behavior.

The motel receptionist recognizes the girl, and says she met an older man at the reception, they argued and he dragged her into his room.

Olivia and Elliot confront her mother and she says Patricia never told who the father of the baby was, she says Patricia told her she didn't know who the father was.They investigate and find out that the judge's adopted son has the same birth date as Patricia's son. They suspect Patricia was sexually abused by the judge and the boy is his son. ADA Cabot gets a warrant to get the boy's DNA and run a paternity test. The test is done and it proves judge Thornburg molested Patricia and is the father of her son. Captain Cragen talks to the judge and he still denies he killed Patricia.

The police suspects burglary gone wrong and ask Mr. Todd if anything from the house is missing, he says he can't find his wife's Rolex watch and doesn't remember if she was wearing it when she was found.Captain Cragen and Fin question the maid and she tells them she doesn't quite like Mr. Todd, and that he made her move out the house after he married Jessica. She tells them her boyfriend took her keys by mistake and they immediately suspect him. They go to talk to Catarina's boyfriend and he tells them about a fight between Mr. and Mrs. Todd.The DNA from Mrs. Todd matches another unsolved rape, so Olivia and Elliot go talk to the victim. Mrs. Johansen tells them she was already in bed when she was attacked and the attacker stole a diamond bracelet, but didn't hit her like Mrs. Todd. Elliot and Olivia discover that both houses had recently changed locks in the same locksmith. They interview the man who changed both locks and he claims he is innocent, but the lab matches his prints to the ones found in both crime scenes, the Johansen bedroom and the Todd kitchen. The police search the van he uses at work, Elliot finds the stolen watch and bracelet in Mr. Ryan's toolbox.In the court, the evidence from the toolbox is suppressed because police searched it without Mr. Ryan's permission or a search warrant. Meanwhile the DNA report is back and it doesn't match Ryan's, so police suspects someone was trying to frame him. They get Mr. Ryan'spermission to search the toolbox for prints and find Mr. Todd's prints in the diamond bracelet. They talk to Mr. Todd and he lies about touching in the locksmith's toolbox and about where the locksmith has been in the house.Olivia and Elliot find out that Mr. Todd is a 72 year old man that hasn't been to New York in twenty years and never met Jessica. They find out that the fake Mr. Todd is scamming Jessica for her money and didn't run away yet because he didn't had all the money he needed. They suspect that Mrs. Johansen is involved in the scam too.

Captain Cragen gets a warrant and they search the apartment. They find a used boarding pass to Winnipeg under the couch cushions. They talk to the Canadian police and find out that fake Mr. Todd visited Canada a few times lately. Captain Cragen tells Elliot and Olivia to send the prints found in the apartment to the Canadian police to see what they can find out.Fin points out that they still don't know whose DNA it is in both victims, since it doesn't match Mr. Ryan's or fake Mr. Todd's. Olivia says maybe Mrs. Johansen user he husband's DNA, since he would never be a suspect, police would never take his DNA to compare with and the case would never be solved. They tell all to Mr. Johansen and ask for him to give a sample of his DNA for comparison. The lab results confirm is Mr. Johansen's DNA in both women.The Canadian police send the real identities of Mr. Todd and Mrs. Johansen and that they were both arrested and convicted for fraud. Olivia and Elliot try to convince Jessica that her husband planned it all to scam her and show her all the papers from the Canadian police but she isn't convinced. She says he confessed everything to her the night before and asked for forgiveness, and she forgave him. She says her husband's lawyer told her she could never testify about what he told her because she is his wife and conversation between spouses is privileged. Mr. Johansen too heard his wife confess to him and later got the call from her lawyer telling him he could not testify.The police do some research and find out that Ed and Denise got married in Mexico before getting married to Jessica and Mr. Johansen, so their marriage to them is void and they both can testify against Ed and Denise. Ed tries to charm Jessica, but she doesn't fall for that anymore.

Fin talks to Claire about her rape, but she doesn't remember anything. He asks about the finger in her purse and she claims she found it in the street the night before.

Olivia and Elliot try to talk to the girl, but she is embarrassed to talk to them and is afraid of her mother's reaction. Elliot asks Katie's mother if she knows of anyone who could've done this, and she tells them Katie is at the day center and at work during the day, so it could've happened any time in one of those places. Elliot and Olivia talk to the supervisor at the day center, he tells the detectives that Katie's mother is over protective and doesn't let Katie take the classes about dating, sexual education and independent living, and that way anyone could've easily take advantage of Katie's lack of knowledge about this subjects. Elliot talks to Katie's best friend and he tells Elliot Katie complained that the bus driver touched Katie inappropriately. Olivia and Elliot also talk to Katie's boss, who confirms the story about the bus driver.Alex tells the detectives they can't arrest the bus driver based on what other people told them, they have to make Katie talk to them and tell them exactly what happened in order to get an arrest warrant for the bus driver. Elliot convinces Mrs. Tolliver to let them talk to Katie again, and they meet at the zoo. Olivia and Alex ask Katie about the bus driver and she tells them he stole her necklace and threatened her is she told anybody, she tells them that he touched her in inappropriate places. Alex says it is enough to get a warrant for his apartment. The bus driver claims it was a gift, but the detectives don't buy it. They ask him if he raped Katie and he denies it, when the detectives tell him Katie is pregnant he says he had a vasectomy, so the baby isn't his. Elliot pleas to Mrs. Tolliver to let Dr. Huang talk to Katie, and she finally gives in. Dr. Huang and Alex talk to Katie and find out Katie's best friend is in fact her boyfriend, she tells them she got her baby from Danny, but when asked if she and Danny touched each other private parts, she denies it. They break the news to her mother and she reacts badly, she says she made an appointment for Katie to have an abortion.At the abortion clinic in the last minute, Scott Lucas the day center manager comes in with an injunction to stop the abortion. He filed a petition to take Katie's custody from her mother. Alex says it is a loose-loose situation, if Katie is considered capable enough to decide if she want to keep her baby or not, the defense lawyers from the rape case can claim she knew what she was doing and consented to having sex. Katie's mother calls the precinct and tells them Katie is missing. The detective find out Danny is also missing. Olivia and Elliot soon find their trail and find the apartment where they are hiding. Katie and Danny agree to go to the precinct. Later at the station, Danny says he told Katie about sex, but she said that what he described was not sex, it was exercise and she did it every day at work. Elliot and Olivia realize that Katie's rapist is her boss at the grocery store.Olivia talk o Katie and her mother, and Katie tells them Mr. Chaney taught her to exercise like that, and made her do it every day. Munch and Fin go talk to Mr. Chaney, but he denies everything, claiming that Katie can't distinguish reality from fantasy sometimes. When Munch asks him to volunteer his DNA for comparison to Katie's baby, Mr. Chaney tells them to talk to his lawyer, furthering suspicions. Alex and Dr. Huang are subpoenaed to testify in Katie's competence hearing, and Alex begs Katie's mother to change her mind and not do the abortion, so the competency hearing is dropped and the rape case is not jeopardized, but Mrs. Tolliver is adamant. At the Competency hearing after Alex's and Huang's testimony and upon seeing her daughter crying on the stand, Mrs. Tolliver decides to stop it and gives up her guardianship of Katie. At the station, Elliot tells Alex that the DNA from Mr. Chaney matches the DNA from Katie's baby, but she says now the defense lawyers can argue Katie is competent and consented to having sex. Olivia and Elliot ask Katie if anyone else knows about the exercises she did with Mr. Chaney, she says no one knew, but she caught him exercising with another girl once, and the other girl has a baby. They investigate it and find out Mr. Chaney had many babies with girls who worked at his markets. Alex proposes a deal and Mr. Chaney agrees to pay child support to all of the children and they inherit a percentage of his businesses when he dies.

The word ""pecavisti"" is written in the confessional's door and Elliot thinks it is a confession from the killer saying ""I have sinned "". The M.E. finds fluids and some unusual traces on the transvestite's body; she believes that whoever had sex with the victim used a steel wool sponge with scouring powder to scrub his own penis before having sex with the victim. Olivia and Elliot talk to the priest who found the boy and he says he didn't know the boy, but says Sister Peg might know who he is. Sister Peg tell Fin he is James Doyle, he ran away from home was trying to earn money to have a sex change operation. Fin asks her about Father Michael and she says he is good priest. The lab finds a match in the system for the DNA from fluids found in the victim, it is from Gus Yoder, a recently paroled arsonist. Munch and Fin arrest the guy, but he claims James Doyle was alive and well after they finished. Dr. Huang observes the interview and says Gus has obsessive compulsive disorder; he asks to look at the crime scene photos and says Gus is not the killer, a person with his type of OCD would never go near a dead body or touch the blood. Dr. Huang also says that ""pecavisti"" does not mean ""I have sinned"", it means ""you have sinned"", he says that this probable is an accusation to the priest or to the church, and that maybe James's death wasn't part of it, he just interrupted the person who was doing it and got killed so he wouldn't tell anyone.Olivia finds out that Father Michaels used to work in a school before he went to that parish and there were some rumors of a priest abusing children there at the time he left. She and Elliot go confront the Father about the rumors, but he says nothing. Meanwhile Fin and Munch talk to the police officer in charge of the abuse case, he says he found at least four boys claiming they were molested, but then the church paid two hundred thousand dollars to each family and made them sign a confidentiality agreement, so there was no case anymore. Olivia manages to track down the boys, she and Elliot go talk to Ben Campion while Munch and Fin talk to Todd Ramsay. Ben says Father Michaels is a good priest and he never touched him. Ha says it was Father Michaels that invited him to run the youth center. Todd isn't very cooperative and says he won't tell anything because of the confidentiality agreement. Fin and Munch then talk to Bobby Douglas, they confront him and he confesses to killing James, he says he had to expose Father Michaels for what he'd done, that the Father ruined his life. The police search Bobby's room and find James's purse and a flashlight with blood. The lab later confirms it is James's blood. Bobby is arrested and Elliot interviews him along with Olivia. Bobby's lawyer wants Alex to make a deal, but she says it depends on what he has to say about the abuse allegations. Bobby gives a statement about the sexual abuse he suffered. Alex gets a warrant to search Father Michaels's room. At the church Rory O'Halloran and Bishop Mallinson try to discourage Elliot and Olivia to execute the search. The detectives do not budge, hoping to find a lot of evidences, but end up finding only a videotape hidden in the shelves. At the precinct they play the tape and in it is Father Michaels saying he likes to watch the boys in the shower room and to touch them. Dr. Huang says it is a common therapy practice of behavioral modification, and because of that Alex's boss says the tape is inadmissible in court so she'll only prosecute Father Michaels if the police offer solid evidence, since a murderer's testimony is not very convincing. Olivia and Elliot ask Ben if they can ask the boys at the youth center about Father Michaels, he says they have to ask permission from the parents. Elliot asks if there is any boy that left the center abruptly, and he answers only one, Darius Retafian, about the same time the Father left the center. Elliot and Olivia talk to Darius's mother and she confirms her son left the center because of Father Michaels. He is arrested, and at the arraignment Mr. O'Halloran, the church's lawyer, threatens Alex saying that if she proceeds with the trial, he is going to do whatever it takes to clear Father Michaels. While Alex is prepping Darius for his testimony on the trial, Mr. O'Halloran shows up at the precinct and suggest Alex to ask Darius about the Father's TV and that if he is telling the truth, he'll be able to say the TV is black and white. She realizes Darius is lying and accuses his mother of making false accusations after settling with the church for the abuse of her son by another priest. Meanwhile they receive the news that Bobby was killed in jail.When Elliot confronts Father Michaels about it, and realizes he was never guilty and was protecting someone else. The Father says he feels guilty for not being able to protect the boys, but the real abuser confessed to him and he can't break the seal of confession. Alex gets a subpoena for all the church's documents regarding sexual abuse by priests to try and find out who could've been the priest that really abused those boys. They learn that Bishop Mallinson, former Father Mallinson, was a Latin professor at the school by the time of the abuse claims. Elliot again talks to Father Michaels and try to reason with him. He says he knows who the real child abuser is, and that he must tell what the bishop told him, he asks the Father what is more important, not breaking his vows, or protecting innocent children from a child molester. Father Michaels finally gives in to his guilt so Elliot arrests the Bishop."

When Olivia and Elliot arrive at the local, another girl raped and strangled is found dead in the club's bathroom. At the precinct, the police make Lisa Perez, the girl that was almost raped at the club, look at line ups with the men arrested at the club to try to identify the one that tried to rape her, but she says the man was gone before the police arrived. Lisa tells Olivia that Sister Peg warned the prostitutes about a guy that was choking working girls. Elliot and Olivia talk to Sister Peg and ask her how she knew about the man strangling hookers, she says it was one of the girls that told her, she keeps a black book with all the bad ""Johns"", so she can warn all the girls. Some time later, another body with the same M.O. is found, Dr. Warner rides in with Fin and Munch to the scene, and they find a thumb print in the victim's forehead. The print is match to Shawn Becker, a recently paroled man convicted of assault and rape, Capt. Craigen asks Olivia and Elliot to give his mug shot to all the working girls. They ask Sister Peg to tell them where the girls that saw him lately are working and she gives them their usual spot. When they arrive at the hotel, the doorman says he just called the police about shots fired in one of the rooms, the detectives show him a picture of the suspect and the doorman confirms he is in the room where the shots came from. Olivia and Elliot go I the room and find a hooker with a gun in her hands and Shawn Becker dead on the floor, she says she shot him. The woman claims she didn't intended to kill the guy; she just wanted him to stop. At the hospital, Olivia asks Deborah what happened, she says she was at a bar looking for a ""john"" and Shawn approached her. She claims that when they arrived at the hotel room and she wanted to discuss the price, he started hitting her and after he raped her, she found his gun and pulled the trigger. At the lab, the bullet from Shawn is a match to another homicide, the only problem being that Shawn, who supposedly owned the gun, was in jail at the time of the murder. The police suspects Deborah owned the gun all along and is responsible for the other murder as well, and that she lied to them when she said the gun belonged to Shawn. Capt. Craigen tells the guys to investigate the first murder and try to find a connection between Deborah and the murder victim. Munch receives a call from the hospital saying that Deborah took off after talking to the police, and that the name and address she gave were fake.Munch and Finn manage to trace a call fake Deborah made at the hospital before disappearing; it is a call to a day care center for children. They go there and ask the manager about the call and get Deborah's real name, Margaret Peterson. Olivia and Benson find a series of unsolved homicides that fit Maggie's pattern: she lures them to her room posing as a prostitute and then kills them and steals their credit cards. Another man's body is found and one of his credit cards is missing, they track down the last charges in it and find Maggie in a hotel with her little son. Elliot arrests her and they call social services to take the child. Dr. Huang asks to talk to Maggie before they interview her and thinks she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, and that she is saying whatever she thinks he want to hear.  Elliot goes to interview her and she starts hitting on him, unbuttoning her blouse. Dr. Huang says she has a ""cocktail"" personality; she reads people and adapts her manners accordingly. The next to interview her is Olivia, who Maggie tries to attack when confronted with the truth, showing her true colors. Alex decides to go for the capital punishment, death penalty, but it is a tough battle since no woman has ever been sentenced to death by a New York court. The judge denies the DA's request to seek the death penalty on Maggie's case, so Alex can do is try to convict Maggie to life without parole. At the trial, the defense tries to make it seem like Maggie killed all those men in self defense because they all raped her. Looking for a way to secure a conviction, Olivia stumbles into Maggie's medical records from the time she was supposed to be eight months pregnant with her son, but the records show no sign of her being pregnant at that time, so they do a DNA comparison and it shows Joey is not Maggie's biological son. Alex finds out that Joey's real mother was killed 18 months before, she confronts Maggie with the facts and offers her a deal, she says she wants to think about it and Alex gives her till the next morning to make her mind. The next day in court, they receive a call saying Maggie killed herself with her pantyhose."

Benson asks her why she is crying and she says it is because her mother loves her 16yr old half-brother Kyle more than her, and that she once caught them in bed together. The teacher warns Stabler that Chloe's father, Lawrence Fuller, is a wealthy business man and has a temper, and that Chloe's mother, Gloria Stanfield, is a minor actress, and that they are both a handful.At the hospital, the doctors say that Chloe's injuries which had first gotten the teacher worried are just the usually scrapes and bruises a child gets, and when her father comes to pick her up he says that old fractures the doctors found are from when she fell when she was three. Benson and Stabler ask him whether he has noticed anything strange about his wife's relationship with his son, and he says no, but storms off and takes Chloe home.Munch and Tutuola go to speak to Kyle at his school, and he denies any inappropriate relationship with his stepmother, but the detectives aren't convinced. The Fuller's housekeeper reluctantly admits that she once caught Gloria kissing Kyle inappropriately. When Benson and Stabler are summoned to Gloria's lawyer's office to meet her, she denies any relationship with Kyle.Later, the detectives are called to a disturbance at Chloe's school and find Gloria and Lawrence arguing. Lawrence accuses Gloria of molesting his children, Gloria accuses him of being violent with them. Benson takes Chloe away and Stabler informs her parents that the kids will be placed in care until the matter is resolved. When Munch and Tutuola go to Kyle's school to pick him up, they find he is already gone. They talk to some of his friends who reveal that Gloria likes to flirt with them and that they wouldn't necessarily be surprised to find out that Kyle was sleeping with her.The detectives get a call that evening and find out that Lawrence Fuller has been murdered in his apartment, bashed with a baseball bat found underneath Kyle's bed. Gloria and Kyle are both missing, but Kyle soon shows up at the building and claims that he just went for a walk and knows nothing about the murder or where Gloria is.Gloria shows up at the station with a lawyer for Kyle, and talks to Benson and Stabler. She says that Lawrence and Kyle were fighting and she couldn't take it, so she left and went to a hotel, but she stops short of implicating Kyle. She says that she has no motive for murder herself, because she signed a prenuptial agreement which means she gets nothing, and all the money goes into trusts for Kyle and Chloe. When Kyle's prints are the only one's found on the murder weapon, he is arrested and charged, but he is released on bail. The detectives get a warrant for Gloria's hotel room, hoping to find the clothes Kyle was wearing when he killed his father. The clerk at the hotel tells them that Gloria left for the airport with a young man that sounds like Kyle, and by the time the detectives find out that they took a flight to Washington D.C., they have already returned.They go to the hotel room and find Kyle and Gloria in bed together. Kyle reveals that they are now married. When interviewed, Gloria insists that nothing happened between them until Kyle was 17, so she has done nothing illegal. The result of their marriage is that neither can now testify against each other because of spousal privilege.Kyle's bail is revoked because he fled the jurisdiction, if only briefly. Cabot finds that the marriage is valid under Virginia state law, where a minor can marry with the permission of a guardian, even if that guardian is the person they are going to marry.Outside the court there are many reporters who have caught onto the story and want a comment, and one asks a question about Gloria's pregnancy. Stabler and Benson drag him aside to ask about the pregnancy (which they didn't know about) and the reporter reveals that Gloria is three months pregnant and took Kyle with her to the doctor's appointment. Benson and Stabler tell Gloria that they need a paternity test, and she says that she will have her lawyer arrange it. The test shows that neither Kyle nor Lawrence are the father. Benson receives a call and is told that Gloria is in the hospital and is claiming that she was raped. She says that it was Frank Barbarosa, her former lover, whom she says admitted to killing Lawrence out of spite and who threatened to do the same to her. Barbarosa is arrested and they find out that he is a personal trainer and had a one hour session with a client in the Fuller's apartment building, however there is an extra half and hour which he spent in the building after the session was over. He denies that he had anything to do with Lawrence's death.The detectives look into his phone records and find that someone called Barbarosa at the time of the murder from the deli across the street. The deli owner confirms that Gloria was in the deli that night and made two calls from the payphone. Meanwhile, the lab technician tells Benson and Stabler that the sperm in Gloria's rape kit is Barbarosa's, but must have been frozen, because the tails are broken. They realize that Gloria faked the rape.Barbarosa wants to implicate Gloria, for a deal, and he admits that he killed Lawrence Fuller. He says that Gloria gave him the security code for the apartment and told him to use the baseball bat to set up Kyle, but he cannot offer any corroborated proof that would really implicate Gloria.The detectives figure out that the second call which Gloria made from the deli must have been to Kyle, telling him to get out of the apartment. They realize that Kyle is willing to take the fall in order to protect Gloria, and that if he goes free from jail, his life may be in danger because, as his wife, Gloria has access to the money in his trust, and might decide she no longer needs him for anything and kill him too.Benson and Stabler visit Kyle in jail and try to convince him that Gloria is setting him up. He is finally convinced when he finds out that the baby is Barbarosa's, not his, and that they are not going to live happily ever after as Gloria promised. Kyle says that Gloria called him the night of the murder, and told him she'd take care of everything.Benson and Stabler catch up with Gloria outside a family planning clinic, as she is intending to abort her pregnancy. Kyle steps out of their car to confront Gloria and to tell her that he doesn't believe her lies anymore and will testify that she abused him and that she was involved in his father's murder. He hands her divorce papers, and the detectives arrest her. Vessa289

The woman claims it is her house, so the couple calls the police. Olivia talks to the old woman, but it seems like she is senile or has some sort of dementia, upon a closer look, Olivia finds cigarette burn marks on her. She is taken to a hospital and examined, but there is no DNA present, the doctors tell Elliot and Olivia that the woman probably has alzheimer's. At the precinct, Elliot and Olivia try to get information out of the old lady, but she is too vague about everything. The detectives decide to start by investigating the address where she broke in, thinking the she must've lived there some time in her life. They track down one of the previous tenants and ask her about the lady. She recognizes the woman and says she was their neighbor when they were kids, her name is Bess Sherman; she also says they suspected Bess was abused by her uncle at the time. Dr. Huang says the latest attack triggers memories of the abuse she suffered when little, so she fled to the only place she felt safe, her friend's house. Knowing her name the police manage to find a nursing home where Bess used to live, there they inform the detectives that Bess's son, Joe Sherman. With a warrant in hands, Elliot and Olivia go to Joe's house. The supper says that since Joe brought Bess home, the collectors stopped showing up and the delivery companies started coming. At the apartment, Olivia finds Bess's bedroom and straps to keep her locked in the room. Joe claims the bills from the nursing home were too expensive, so he took her home, and the straps were for her own protection.In Joe's trash, Fin and Munch find a lot of cigarette buds, and some fingerprints in them. Bess's finances show large amounts o money to someone, they assume it is for Joe, but he claims it must've been for his son, Andy.  Andy admits he asked for the money, but only because the college fund that Bess had set up for him was used by Joe years ago. Andy denies hurting Bess, but says he was there with a friend, even though he doesn't believe his friend would do anything to Bess either, as he works at the nursing home. At the Jubilee Towers Nursing Home, Elliot and Olivia talk to Hal Shipley, but he denies it all. The manager says they had only one complaint about him, but it was from an alzheimer's patient, so they believed it wasn't true. Munch and Fin talk to the nursing patients, and many say they were harassed by Hal, but nobody believed them because they are senile or were under the effects of some medication at the time. Alex finds records of a suit against Jubilee Towers that was settled with a confidentiality clause. They decide to exhume the patient's body to see if there was any fowl play in it, and Melinda finds a needle prick that was unaccounted for in the medical records. She says that because of the embalming process is impossible to examine her for poisons, but it is possible that the needle prick is related to her death. Olivia and Elliot talk about the suit with Hope Garrett, the Nursing Home's manager and she says they settled it out of the court, because it was easier, and that many grieving families need to blame someone for their relative's death so they sue, but there was no fowl play from their part. They ask to speak with the staff about Hal. All of a sudden, there is a code blue in Bess's room and the detectives rush there. Hope is there, panicking she accuses Hal of doing it because she had just fired him. The doctors take Bess to another room and Olivia sees a fresh needle mark in Bess's arm. Elliot and Olivia go after Hal and ask him of his whereabouts for the last 15 minutes, but he refuses to cooperate.At the station, Capt. Craigen gives Hal the news, his fingerprint was found in one of the cigarette buds in Joe's trash, the Captain lies to Hal that in the other end of the bud was Bess's seared flesh, so they can prove he was the one that assaulted her that night. He confesses to burning her with the cigarette, but swears that he didn't go near Bess the day she coded, he proves by confessing he was hacking the Nursing Home's computer to steal drugs at the time. Munch and Fin check the computer and confirm Hal's story. Elliot and Olivia come to the conclusion that if Hal is telling the truth, the only other person that could've done it was Hope. They talk to the nurses and they say Mrs. Garrett saved people that were coding before. The detectives suspect she creates a crisis so she can save the day and receive all the attention. Elliot finds out that Hope Garrett was a nurse and had her license suspended. Olivia and Elliot arrest Hope at the Nursing Home.

The Medical Examiner concludes the victim was stabbed to death and sexually assaulted. The detectives have a hard time identifying the victim or finding any suspects. The woman's dog is found a while later, the dog had one of her shoes with it and due to an orthopedic heel in it they are able to fin out the victim's identity, she was a public health doctor named Greta Esterman. Olivia and Elliot talk to her husband, he tells the detectives her work involved tracking sexual partners of patients recently diagnosed with HIV to have them checked as well. Mr. Esterman says his wife occasionally received hate mail and threatening calls, but never paid any attention to it. The detectives go through Greta's log of all the threatening calls and find one threat that matches the crime, it is from Roger Pomerantz. When Elliot and Olivia go to talk to Roger, he tries to flee, so he is arrested on violation of his parole. He is interviewed but has an alibi, so he is released; at that time, Mr. Esterman is arriving at the station to deliver some of Greta's work documents that might help in the investigation, they both cross paths and Mr. Esterman believing Roger is his wife's killer, looses control and punch him. Dr. Warner analyzes Greta's papers and comes to the conclusion she was trying to identify the common source of the HIV from some her patients, she believed they all had the same source. The detectives think that maybe Greta was close to finding the person that was spreading the HIV, so that person killed her. They follow the list of people she tracked and interview people trying to establish who gave it to whom, trying to find the source, they believe it is Mario Molinari, since he can be connected directly or indirectly to all the infected people. Elliot and Olivia find Mario at a hospital and confront him about Dr. Esterman's death, it turns out he was in the hospital at the time, but Elliot arrests Mario for knowingly giving HIV to people, since he knew about his condition and still had unprotected sex without telling his partners about his HIV. Meanwhile another body is found in the park, leading the detectives to think there is a serial killer on the loose, but the ME thinks maybe it is a copycat, since the injuries sustained by the second victim are not as many and not as and as the first victim. The forensics analyst disagrees; he found exactly the same evidence in both crime scenes, the same footprints and the same knife type. He also says that both types of soils are unique to that place, so of they catch a suspect, they can analyze his shoes, and match it to them giving no doubt about who killed those women. Olivia and Elliot try to find a connection between the victims, so they talk to Greta's friend. She tells about Greta's marriage to Arthur, how her family was against it because she was rich and he wasn't, and how Greta was the one who supported the couple. Elliot asks if any of them could've had any affair, and she reveals Greta asked her to check a man's credit report, the man's mane was Vartan Dadian. The detectives investigate this Vartan guy and find out he had an account and received a steady amount of money from Greta's account every month, they also find charges to an escort service in Vartan's name. Munch and Fin go to the Escort agency and get the name of the lady that serves Vartan regularly, Miss Kitty. Elliot and Olivia talk to Vartan Dadian about it, but he denies having an account in the bank in question, and claims he never met Greta or Miss Kitty. The detectives realize someone was using Mr. Dadian's identity to open the account and hire escorts, probably to hide from somebody. Munch and Fin interview Miss Kitty at the precinct and she recognizes Mr. Esterman's picture as being Vartan Dadian. The detective get a search warrant for Mr. Esterman's home, trying to fin some solid evidence that can prove he murdered his wife when she found out about his affair and decided to divorce him, because if she divorced him he would be left with nothing. Munch finds a dirty pair of shoes in Arthur's bedroom that matches the shoe-prints found in the crime scene, the lab matches the dirt from the crime scenes and the dirt on the shoes. Mr. Esterman denies any involvement in the murders and claims he was in the park after the murders, to lay flowers there. He argues that he took an alias to meet with escort girls to protect his wife; when asked for a DNA sample, he replies his DNA is expected to be found in his wife, but Elliot reveals they are going to match his DNA against a hair found in the other victim's body. The judge denies the warrant for Mr. Esterman's DNA, but Elliot finds out he already gave a DNA sample; in a fund-raising charity event, he donated blood, so they ask the judge to use that blood to compare to the sample in the victims body. They argue that he waved any right to privacy when he donated the blood, since it would be tested anyway in a hospital. The judge hears both sides and agrees to let the State test the blood, but only the same tests that would be done in the hospital to which he donated the blood. The test comes back and they find a high amount of Viagra and ecstasy, so they talk to Arthur's drug dealer, he gives up the address to where he delivers the drugs.Munch and Fin go there with a search warrant and catch him in bed with Miss Kitty; there they find a one-way ticket to Brazil and Kitty gets furious when she realizes he was planning to go alone. Kitty gives the detectives a sample of Mr. Esterman's DNA and they match it to the hair from the second crime scene. Arthur Esterman admits killing his wife and the other woman to divert the detectives, he claims she drove him to it, when she lost her sexual appetite; he tried to make her try the ecstasy, but she refused so he started seeing prostitutes, she found out and was going to divorce him leaving him with no money for his ecstasy or the prostitutes, so he had to kill her.

Campbell|4|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/angels-194175/recap|http://www.tv.com|"An airport bus arrives at Kennedy Airport with an unexpected passenger: a young boy in the luggage compartment, dead of carbon monoxide asphyxiation.  He has a large cut on one arm, and has also been beaten and sexually abused. Although the airport is in Queens, the bus began its journey in Manhattan and made no stops along the way. The Queens SVU detective gladly turns the case over to Elliot Stabler.Elliot and Olivia visit the maintenance yard, where the bus began its journey. They find a torn piece of a shirt snagged on a hole in the yard's chain-link fence, and a teddy bear under the wheel of the bus. The bear looks new, and has blood and broken glass on it. A security video from the previous night shows two boys, one older than the other, slipping through the hole in the fence. The older boy's shirt snags on the fence and tears. The younger boy, who's holding the teddy bear, appears to be willingly accompanying the older boy.The blood on the bear matches the victim's. Broken glass similar to that on the bear, is also in the cut on the dead boy's arm. The glass is tempered safety glass, the kind used for soundproofing. The victim is not a street kid. He's clean, well-nourished and healthy, and has $10,000 worth of dental work performed within the last month. He has a custom-made dental implant which can be traced to the manufacturer, and to the dentist who ordered it. A rape kit tested positive for semen, and recently healed suture scars are on the boy's anus.The older boy, Ernesto Diaz, is later found at the Port Authority terminal. He is devastated to learn that the younger boy, his friend Jose, is dead. Both of them are from Guatemala. Ernesto came to New York by boat two years ago, to go to school. Instead, the charity who brought him to the States gave him to a man named Bret Jansen. Jose arrived only the previous month, Jansen having said that Ernesto was becoming too old to please him. Jansen kept both boys locked up, forced them to have sex with him, and beat them when they refused.No U.S. government agency has any record of Ernesto or Jose, so the boys were smuggled into the States. Jansen is a partner at a Wall Street law firm, but at the moment he's missing in action. SVU obtains a search warrant for his loft. The heavy-duty soundproofed door has multiple deadbolt locks, all unlocked. Inside, the detectives find a super-secured home environment and the broken window Ernesto and Jose had escaped through.  In the bedroom is the mutilated, bloody body of Bret Jansen. His throat was cut, and his genitals were cut off.Cragen wonders if Ernesto killed Jansen, to stop the abuse. Elliot and Olivia doubt it. Jansen's bedroom had been a bloodbath, and Ernesto hadn't had a drop on him. CSU found fresh traces of blood in Jansen's shower, indicating that the killer had tried to clean up after himself. An adult might think of that, but a teenager wouldn't.Ernesto tells Olivia that Jansen had passed him around to other men, who would return him afterward. Jansen had threatened to do the same with Jose. Rather than see that happen, Ernesto helped Jose escape. Huang says the brutality of Jansen's murder suggests jealousy, therefore a personal connection.  Elliot agrees; Jansen's loft was so secure, he had to have known his killer.A search of Jansen's loft turns up a repugnant videotape of Jansen with a third boy. Another man with  tattoos on his back and his forearm is also in the video, but his face is never shown.  The search also finds phony adoption papers for Ernesto and Jose, and literature from the North American Man-Boy Love Association. Jansen was one utterly worthless human being, so much so that Elliot comments, ""Let's face it. Killing Jansen was a public service.""Jose's dental implant is traced to dentist Walt Massey. He tells Munch and Fin that he didn't know Jansen well, but he admired Jansen for adopting two boys from a foreign country. Jansen wanted only the best for his sons. Asked if Jansen had referred any other patients recently, Massey replies no.Elliot and Olivia visit Jansen's law firm and talk with his secretary. She tells them that Jansen had neither family nor children. His desk calendar shows a recent lunch date with his client Stewart Lynch, at the Metropolis Club.Lynch, a plastic surgeon, tells Elliot and Olivia that Jansen had been a real ladies' man. The only children they ever discussed were Lynch's. Because Jansen had a terrible temper, Lynch thinks Jansen would have made a lousy father and that kids would have driven him crazy. Jansen had also been friends with club member Tony Damon, with whom he'd played squash. The night of Jansen's murder, Lynch was in the operating room all night trying to repair an auto accident victim's mangled hand.Damon had just returned from a business trip the night of Jansen's murder. He travels a great deal for work, so he spends any downtime he has relaxing at home. He says that Jansen, the better squash player, had a strange sense of humor. During one game, Damon served an ace which Jansen laughed off as a lucky shot. Jansen said Damon usually played like a woman, and that he should have cut Damon's balls off long ago.Warner tells Elliot and Olivia that Jansen's genitals ""weren't exactly cut off."" They had been surgically removed with a scalpel by someone who knows anatomy, and pre-mortem. The killer had also precisely cut the carotid arteries on either side of Jansen's neck. Lynch, the plastic surgeon, certainly could have killed Jansen and sewn up Jose.Elliot and Olivia ask Ernesto if Jansen had ever taken him and Jose to a doctor. Ernesto replies that the doctor would come to see them at home when they were sick. Shown several pictures one at a time, Ernesto identifies Lynch as their doctor.Background checks reveal that Lynch has three adopted sons. Damon owns a travel agency called Global Voyages. Cell phone records reveal that the night Jansen was murdered, he made separate calls to Lynch and Damon. Then Damon called Lynch back. U.S. Customs records show that Jansen traveled to Guatemala two years ago, about the same time that Ernesto came to New York. Damon is setting up his friends on sex tours, from which they bring back human souvenirs. The friends then pass the boys around among themselves. SVU is dealing with a ring of pedophiles, not just one offender.Realizing that Lynch must also be part of the ring, SVU seeks to remove his sons immediately from his custody. Alex Cabot tells Elliot and Olivia that neither the phone calls nor Lynch's ethical failure to report Jose's abuse, are sufficient evidence to justify removal. Olivia then shows Alex an old e-mail from Damon, found on Jansen's computer: ""Your special tour to Central America is confirmed. If your friends enjoy, have them get in touch."" Damon is soliciting men to travel overseas and rape children, which is a federal crime. Alex tells the detectives to catch Damon in the act.Under another name, Munch contacts Damon by e-mail. After checking ""John Blackmun's"" credit to verify his identity, Damon invites Munch to visit him at his travel agency. Munch says and does all the right things, including paying in cash. Eventually Damon takes the bait and offers to arrange a sex tour, complete with souvenir videotape. Munch then reveals his real identity and arrests Damon. Fin and several other officers enter the office and seize the agency's files and computers.Initially, Damon blows off SVU. New York has no state law against sex tours, and federal law requires a complaining victim which SVU doesn't have. Quickly enough he changes his tune when he realizes he's the best suspect they have for Jansen's murder, especially since Jansen had said he ""should have cut off [Damon's] balls long ago."" Damon says he told Lynch about that joke. While Damon had arranged the sex tours, Jansen and Lynch had obtained their ""sons"" themselves. During his own trip to Guatemala, Lynch had hand-picked Jose for Jansen. The night Jansen was murdered, he called Lynch after discovering Ernesto and Jose's escape. Lynch had called Damon to ask about the souvenir videotape of his tour; Damon had told him it was on the way.  Damon begs for a deal, in exchange for his delivering Lynch to them.The sex tours are a federal matter, so Alex can't make a deal with Damon there. She won't grant him immunity until she's sure he didn't kill Jansen. Cragen suggests that perhaps they can nail Lynch without Damon's help, since Lynch's sex tour videotape is in the mail.The package containing Lynch's videotape arrives. The mail carrier has barely departed when Lynch comes out and scoops it off the front step.  SVU raids his house, catches him eagerly watching the tape, and arrests him.Lynch insists he legally adopted his boys. Alex replies that the adoption papers are phony. The police have located the INS agent Lynch and Jansen paid to obtain their boys' visas. Lynch is facing some serious federal charges. Told that his hospital said he was on vacation the night of Jansen's murder, Lynch clarifies that the surgery he performed that night was at a different hospital 350 miles away. To curry favor with the U.S. Attorney, Lynch gives Alex the names of all the pedophile ring members he knows.SVU picks up 17 other members of the ring. Lynch's out-of-town alibi is confirmed, leaving Jansen's murder still unsolved. The doctor's report on Lynch's sons says that they have perfect teeth. Elliot then remembers the dentist, Walt Massey. He wasn't one of Damon's sex tour clients, nor is he a member of the Metropolis Club. He is married, with two young sons. The pedophile ring had its own doctor, Lynch. Logically it would have its own dentist, too.SVU obtains a search warrant for Massey's home. Walt isn't there, but his wife is. Olivia sees a picture of the sons, and comments on their lack of resemblance to Walt.  Mrs. Massey, a kind and sensitive woman, explains that the boys are her children from a previous marriage. Their father is in prison for trying to kill her, and he's lost his parental rights. She met Walt when he answered a personal ad she put in the newspaper, and he adopted the boys after marrying her.Under gentle questioning from Olivia, Mrs. Massey admits that her husband spends a lot of time alone with the older son, Shawn. It's painfully apparent that Mrs. Massey knows there may be something about Walt. However, she met him at an extremely vulnerable time in her life. Walt had saved her and her sons from a homeless shelter and given them a real home, free of physical abuse.Back at the squad room, Elliot gently questions Shawn one-on-one. Shawn eventually all but admits that his stepfather had sex with him. Even though she saw it coming, Mrs. Massey is still  devastated to hear Shawn reveal the truth.Walt Massey is brought in. Under skillful maneuvering from Elliot, Massey eventually trusts him enough to say, ""[Jansen's], uh…his punishment was especially appropriate, don't you think?"" Elliot then grabs Massey and reveals the tattoo on the dentist's forearm. Massey is the second, unseen man in Jansen's sex tour videotape. When Elliot tells him they found broken window glass from Jansen's loft in his sneaker, Massey admits to killing Jansen. Massey had seen the bruises on Jose's body when the boy was his patient. Jansen's abusiveness put the whole pedophile ring at risk, so Massey killed him to make sure he never hurt another boy again.However, Massey is completely oblivious to the idea that a man having sex with a boy is wrong. As Elliot literally backs him into a corner of the room, a cowering, pitiful Massey argues that he's different from Jansen:  ""I never forced Shawn. I never beat him like Jansen beat his boys.  It's not the same thing!""  A totally disgusted Elliot replies, ""It's worse. You had sex with your stepson and you don't think there's anything wrong with that. What kind of sick bastard are you?"""

After looking for her initially in the emergency room, they find out that the victim, Stephanie Rawley, is actually a coma patient in the intensive care ward. Stephanie had gone into a coma after a car accident a year ago, and had recently been transferred to the hospital from a rehab centre. The doctor at the hospital ordered some tests, and found that she was pregnant, and called SVU.When Stephanie's parents are informed, they immediately suspect her fiancée David Anderson, against whom they have a restraining order because he 'tried to kill her'. When Munch and Tutuola go to speak with David, he explains that Stephanie's wishes were that she not be kept alive artificially, but her parents don't understand. He insists that he has kept away from the hospital since the restraining order was put in place. He reveals that the car crash Stephanie was in was his fault, because she got hit by a truck while going to pick him up from his bucks party.While not counting out David as a suspect, the detectives believe it is more likely that a staff member at the rehab centre raped Stephanie. They ask Cabot what they could do to secure DNA from every member of the staff, and she says that it isn't possible unless everyone consents. Cregan tells them they should try to get voluntary DNA samples from everyone they can now, and test whichever ones they feel necessary later.Benson and Stabler interview Dr. Mandell, whom they find alone in a room with another coma patient, and find that he is willing to give a DNA test. Munch and Tutuola talk to Clark Jensen, a physiotherapist, who is also willing to volunteer his DNA. Jensen admits to them that he has seen David Anderson at the hospital late at night, in Stephanie's bed.Munch and Tutuola go back to talk to David, and he admits that the night nurse feels sorry for him and lets him in to see Stephanie, and that he holds her because he believes it calms her down. He is also willing to volunteer his DNA.Mrs. Rawley, Stephanie's mother, calls Benson and is frantic when she finds out that Stephanie has suddenly been transferred back to the rehab centre without her knowledge. Benson and Stabler go to the centre and find Stephanie is about to undergo an abortion, performed by a Dr. Garrison, which they manage to stop in time. They talk to Dr. Mandell, who authorised the procedure, who says that the pregnancy puts Stephanie's life in danger. He reveals that he had Stephanie's father's consent to perform the procedure.Mr. and Mrs. Rawley fight over Stephanie's pregnancy- Mrs. Rawley, a strict Catholic, wants to keep it, but Mr. Rawley has less affectionate views towards the baby. Stabler questions Mr. Rawley about the lunch breaks he spends by Stephanie's bedside, alone, and Rawley loses his temper and hits him. Stabler refuses to arrest Rawley for hitting him, thinking he would have reacted the same way.Back at the station, they debate whether Mr. Rawley's reaction was too strong, and why Mrs. Rawley would want to keep the baby. Olivia's situation (of her mother choosing to keep her after she was raped) is brought up. Until the baby is born, they have no DNA for a paternity test, so in the meantime, they decide to question the only two men at the rehab centre who refused to give their DNA. One of these men is a conspiracy theorist who doesn't want to be framed; the other is a hypochondriac who doesn't want to know if he has any diseases once his DNA is tested. The hypochondriac suggests that Benson and Stabler talk to an employee from a funeral home, who goes to the centre to pick up bodies and occasionally loiters around the coma wing.Benson and Stabler talk to the funeral home employee, Wesley Dilbert, about why he roams the hospital (he says to get snacks from vending machines), and then question him about a dropped assault accusation against him made by a prostitute named Maxine. Wesley denies he did anything to Maxine, and accuses her of stealing his wallet.The detectives speak with Maxine, who says she only stole Wesley's wallet so she would know his name to report him, but dropped the charges because the police didn't take her seriously because she was a prostitute. She tells them that Wesley had trouble performing, and wanted her to lie in a bath filled with ice to bring her body temperature down.Benson and Stabler go to talk to Wesley again, and he denies everything. They find out that he has only been working at that funeral home a couple of months, and Munch and Tutuola talk to his previous employer. The employer tells them that Wesley was caught on security video having relations with a deceased woman.Benson and Stabler interrogate Wesley, and show him video of the incident at the funeral home. He becomes very nervous, but Huang pulls Benson out of the room, telling her that Wesley's problem is that he is terrified of women. Stabler tries empathising with him, but Wesley refuses to admit he ever went into Stephanie Rawley's room. The detectives think he is lying, but Huang says it is possible that he can't bring himself to perform with living women. Cabot has him charged with necrophilia to get him off the street, but the judge grants him bail.Huang suggests that in order to speed up the case, they might try to get DNA from Stephanie's baby without harming the foetus, using a new experimental procedure he knows about. The blood type does not match Wesley or Stephanie's fiancée, but it does match Dr. Mandell. They interrogate him, and he denies raping Stephanie, but Huang brings in a picture of the uterus of another female coma patient in Mandell's care, and the picture shows signs of scarring from a recent abortion.They find out that the second coma patient's abortion was performed by Dr. Garrison, the same woman who tried to abort Stephanie's foetus. She and Dr. Mandell work together at a research lab that specialises in research into Parkinson's disease. Garrison reveals that, due to government banning of stem cell research, they were forced to get private financing for their research. A wealthy man suffering Parkinson's disease, Davis Langley, paid them to produce stem cells which would match him by inseminating Stephanie Rawley.Mandell says that his insemination of Stephanie was legal, because her parents signed a blanket consent form covering experimental procedures. Their intention was to abort the pregnancy and inject stem cell's into Davis Langley's brain. Mandell reveals that he is motivated by watching his own father die of Parkinson's.Stabler and Cabot try to speak to Langley, but his lawyer does not allow it. He tells them that Langley was unaware of the research, and didn't know what the samples he gave were being used for. Cabot is able to get an indictment for Mandell and Garrison, but not Langley. She reveals that there is a loophole in the law which means that it is hard to convict someone for stealing human eggs. Huang advises her to appeal to the jury, who all have mothers, daughters, etc., who Stephanie Rawley might remind them of.During the trial, Mrs. Rawley tells the jury about Stephanie's condition and how she visits her everyday, firm in the belief that Stephanie is still alive in there and may wake up one day. The defence lawyer, Trevor Langan, suggests that Stephanie was such a nice person, she would've wanted to help people with Parkinson's like this, but Mrs. Rawley disputes, saying Stephanie never would have agreed to an abortion.Mandell takes the stand and talks about stem cell research and its potential for curing disease. Cabot worries that the defence's case might be winning over the jury, who all know someone who has suffered with a disease that stem cells might be able to cure.Langley surprisingly decides to testify on behalf of the defence, and tells the jury about his terrible experiences suffering with Parkinson's. He admits that the insemination of coma patients was his idea, because he believed that Stephanie was probably dead (her body just kept alive on machines), and he would rather use her than ask a woman to get pregnant just to have an abortion. He says that he is not worried about going to jail, because it is nothing compared to what he has suffered.The jury is won over by the defence, and only finds Mandell and Garrison guilty on battery- a slap on the wrist. Mrs. Rawley comes in to the station, frantic again, because Langley has petitioned for custody of Stephanie's baby once it is born, claiming it because he is the father. They realise that the only reason he wants the baby is for the umbilical cord, which holds stem cells which would be a match to him.

The drug squad want to take credit for finding the woman's drug crop, so one of the officers calls a buddy of his at SVU, who happens to be Tutuola. Fin takes over the case for SVU, but lets the Narcotics police take credit for seizing the woman's marijuana crop.The victim, Susan O'Striker, has been hit in the head with the telephone, raped and then stabbed many times to death with a knife from her own kitchen. The pattern of the killer, running back and forth throughout the apartment reveals that he is lacking some logic, and may be on drugs or mentally disturbed. The body has been covered after the woman was murdered, and someone has thrown up- possibly the killer, feeling remorse.Benson and Stabler speak to O'Striker's neighbour who tipped off the narcotics police about her activities, although she never actually saw O'Striker dealing drugs. The M.E. is able to determine that there is no sperm in the rape kit, and that the killer may have some sort of medical problem. She also reveals that the victim had advanced ovarian cancer and probably would have only lived another year. Munch suggests that she may have been growing the drugs to use for medicinal purposes, and that she might have a 'club' with other sufferers who share the drugs.They find one of O'Striker's notebooks, with a hundred people listed, but only by their initials. Matching these against her phone records, they are able to find other members of the 'club'. Benson and Stabler interview one woman suffering from Multiple Sclerosis who says that most of the club members are too weak to attack anyone, but mentions the violent husband of one woman who used to share the drugs. Munch and Tutuola speak to this man, but find that his alibi holds up for the time of the killing.Warner analyses the contents of the vomit found at the scene, and determines that it is the contents of a school lunch which is served at middle schools across the city. They realise that the killer they are looking for is a child (no sperm because he's not fully mature, and an immature thought process). Huang is not able to offer a helpful profile, but they suspect that the killer would want to stay within their comfort zone. Benson and Stabler decide to interview the son of the neighbour who tipped off the drug squad, and find out that he was given a brand new Mp3 player by another boy at school. Mark admits that he told this boy, Jeremy Brice, that he had a drug dealer living next door.Benson and Stabler pick up Jeremy while he is waiting for the bus, and find that he has blood on his jacket. He was not in school at the time of the murder and his prints are in the apartment. Munch and Tutuola go to Jeremy's school and find out that although he has trouble fitting in, there has never been any serious trouble with him. Believing that Jeremy might have an accomplice, they ask for a list of all the boys absent from school at the time of the murder, and search their lockers. In the locker of Zachary Connors they find the knife that killed Susan O'Striker, as well as her wallet.There are three sets of fingerprints on the knife. The detectives look find out that Zachary is a straight-A student who has never been in any trouble. When they interview him with his parents, he seems to have an answer for everything. He says he wasn't absent from school, but that he was in the library studying for a test, and that he is not really friends with Jeremy. He says that he found the knife and wallet in a dumpster, that Jeremy told him to look there, and that he had intended to hand them both in. Jeremy is more loyal to Zachary, and refuses to say anything that might implicate him. That is, until the detectives show him a video of Zachary's statement that implicates Jeremy. Jeremy admits that it was his idea to break into the apartment, so people would think he was cool, but that Zachary attacked Susan O'Striker.As Zachary is 12 years old, he will be charged in the children's court. Jeremy is 14, however, so it is up to Cabot to decide where he should be tried. She wants to send him to family court, but the DA overrules her and wants Jeremy tried for murder as an adult. Cabot argues with Liz Donnelly over this, claiming that Jeremy doesn't deserve the sentence he might receive if charged as an adult. Donnelly disagrees, saying that Jeremy had an opportunity to leave the apartment, to get help, etc., but instead decided to hand Zach the knife he used to kill Susan O'Striker. She decides that, since Cabot objects so much to trying Jeremy as an adult, she will take the case and Cabot will be her second chair.Outside the court, Cabot and Donnelly run into Jeremy's lawyer, Gina Bernardo, who hands them a motion of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect- due to Jeremy's 14 year old brain. Bernardo is able to present scientific studies which show that despite the law ruling that Jeremy is old enough to be tried as an adult, the adolescent brain is actually not capable of distinguishing things the way and adult brain does. The judge allows the defence.A scientist testifies at the trial about a study which mapped the brains of a group of teenagers. The study determined that teenagers are 'wired' so that they have erratic thought processes and are prone to impulsive behaviour that they cannot adequately control. On cross, Donnelly questions the credibility of the evidence by getting the scientist to admit that the study only really shows that teenagers are 'prone' to such behaviour, and there is no guarantee, nor does the study seek to prove which teenager will behave criminally and which will not.Jeremy takes the stand and Bernardo asks him about his concept of right and wrong. His testimony is confused and he doesn't seem to know whether it is worse to lie about a terrible act being committed or to betray a friend. On cross examination, Donnelly accuses him of knowing exactly what Zachary intended to use the knife for, and of not doing anything to prevent it. Jeremy breaks down and cries.Donnelly is upset after having to make Jeremy breakdown on the stand. She tells Cabot that she wants her to call Zach to the stand, as now that his own case in family court is over with, he can be called as a witness. She also requests that Cabot be the one to examine him. When Zach testifies, he insists that Jeremy was the one who attacked and killed Susan O'Striker but is adamant that he was not at all scared at any point. Cabot plays on his arrogance and makes him admit that he was not afraid, it was Jeremy who was afraid and Jeremy who threw up, thereby implicating himself instead.Donnelly and Cabot offer Jeremy a deal, 5-10 years minimum, a very generous offer considering that he might get 25 to life if the jury finds him guilty. Jeremy's mother is adamant, however, that Zachary's testimony and apparent confession cleared her son in the jury's eyes and that he will be found innocent. She refuses the deal.The jury makes a finding of guilty. Bernardo polls the jury and finds that most of them believed that Jeremy was guilty. Vessa289

One of the men is busy telling a story, but the other man is busy watching a girl in school uniform out of the corner of his eye. As the express train rushes past the station, she attempts to jump in front of it, and he pulls her back just in time.Benson and Stabler arrive on the scene as the girl is being put into an ambulance. She is 15 years old and looks very traumatised, and the paramedics say she was not wearing panties. She tells Elliot her name is Jackie Landricks. The detectives view security camera footage from the station and notice that a young man was following Jackie, but ran away when she tried to jump. They are able to discern the logo of a bike messenger service from his T-Shirt, and find that he was fired but the company gives them his name- Karl Serrit.Benson and Stabler go to see Jackie at the hospital. The doctor says that Jackie had been raped, and that she had restraint marks across her body where she had been tied down. Stabler talks to Tom Landricks, Jackie's father, about volunteering DNA samples from the men in the family and he does not object. Jackie says that someone grabbed her and put her in a van as she was walking home from school. She says she was blindfolded during the attack, but IDs Cark Serrit from a photo array, as she noticed him following her at the subway station. She adds that her rapist had a studded penis.Munch and Tutuola interview Karl, who has a record of violence against another woman. He denies ever knowing Jackie Landricks. Munch and Tutuola keep offering Karl sodas until he needs to use the bathroom. They accompany him and notice that he is studded like Jackie's attacker, and arrest him on this basis. Gina Bernardo, Karl's lawyer, storms in and takes away all the empty cans which Munch is trying to collect, so they cannot get Karl's DNA from them. She argues that they essentially tricked Karl into thinking he could not leave, and that she would stop them from compelling any DNA from him based on the fact that they saw his was studded.Meanwhile, Warner recalls that she has seen a similar pattern of restraints on a victim before. A body nicknamed ""Chelsea Doe"" was found dumped in the water with head and fingers chopped off, though she was probably strangled, and restraint patterns similar to Jackie's. She has also finished analysing Jackie's rape kit and found DNA from two separate men, one of whom takes medication for cholesterol and is therefore older than Karl. The DNA does not match Jackie's father.Benson and Stabler visit the Landricks house to speak to Jackie again and find that her mother, Angie, runs a day care centre in the home. They talk to Jackie up in her room, but she is not very helpful in explaining why she didn't notice that there were two perps, and cannot offer any additional clues. Stabler leaves the room and speaks to Jackie's six-year-old sister Sally, who is very affectionate and takes his pen 'as a gift for her'. She reveals that a man named James Randall lives in the room next to Jackie and Stabler finds his cholesterol medication. When he returns to Jackie's room to ask her about Randall, she becomes very defensive and storms out. They suspect that she knows it was Randall who raped her.Munch and Tutuola interrogate Randall and he denies having anything to do with Jackie, and is horrified when they show him pictures of Chelsea Doe. He agrees to give a DNA sample to clear himself. They cannot get a DNA sample from Karl, because Bernardo successfully argued that Munch and Tutuola coerced him to go to the toilet, and they wouldn't have cause to get DNA if it weren't for seeing the stud. Meanwhile, the doctor informs Benson that Jackie has cervical dysplasia, so despite her insistence that she has never had a boyfriend, she has apparently had quite a few. Benson and Stabler go to Jackie's school to talk to her teacher, who admits that she had concerns when she found out Jackie was dating an older boy. She reveals that Jackie was dating Karl Serrit. They go to speak to Jackie at her home again and she admits that Karl was her boyfriend but that she doesn't know who raped her and the only reason she pointed to Karl was because she wanted someone to blame. She becomes very hostile when the detectives begin to lose patience with her story and insinuate that she knows more than she is saying. They ask her father, Tom Landricks, why he rented a room to Randall next to his teenage daughter, and he admits he was stupid but they needed the money. Normally, he only rents the room to women.Angie Landricks comes in with a bunch of kids, including Sally, who drags Elliot away and gives him a present of a bracelet. Stabler talks to Huang about Sally's behaviour, saying she is a little too affectionate. Huang says it is possibly a sign of abuse, but Stabler says the kids seem happy at home, otherwise.The DNA kit from Jackie's rape gets a hit, a butcher named Eno who has a violent history. He denies ever touching Jackie, but says that he slept with Angie Landricks. The other DNA sample also finds a match- Randall. Randall seems shocked by the result, but says that he never touched Jackie, but he did sleep with Angie Landricks. He says that it was Tom Landricks' idea, and that he paid Randall.Huang analyses Tom Landricks and says that he is narcissistic and sex-obsessed. He treats the children like adults, and pimps out his wife and daughter to make up for the fact that he's probably impotent and/or infertile. Jackie won't speak against him, because she doesn't want to be accused as the one who broke up the family.They call in Child Services to take away the Landricks children as well as the children in Angie Landricks' day care. Benson and Stabler arrest Angie, who accuses Jackie of bringing this all upon them, and they are perplexed to find two little boys in the house who don't belong in the day care. Sally reveals that they are her brothers, although they clearly have another father.When interviewing Angie, she admits that the boys are hers and that Tom wanted her to have more children, although he himself couldn't father anymore after Sally. He brought random men in off the street to father the children. Angie herself is now unable to have anymore children, so therefore it is Jackie's turn to supply the babies. Benson and Stabler decide to talk to Jackie again, but find that she has been moved to a specialist centre because she has had some sort of breakdown. In the hallway, they run into Tom Landricks and he and Elliot nearly come to blows. Huang tells them that Jackie has regressed to a childlike state of mind, due to the trauma. Stabler suggests that she could easily be faking it, and Huang suggests that he talk to her, since he is the father figure that she is now looking to replace. He goes into the room where Jackie is and they sort of play with a doll and a teddy bear, while Stabler tries to get Jackie to admit what's really going on in her family. She finally admits that her father tied her down and inseminated her (with Randall and Eno's sperm, from their liaison with Angie Landricks).Tom Landricks' lawyer wants a deal- he will plead guilty on promoting prostitution, a misdemeanour. She threatens to slam Jackie's testimony in court as that of a troubled, promiscuous girl. Cabot refuses the deal absolutely.In court, Jackie falters when testifying against her father. She cannot bring herself to do it and instead accuses Stabler of confusing her and making her lie, and says that her parents would never hurt her. Without Jackie's testimony, there is no case, meaning the children will go home to Tom and Angie. They find out that Jackie is pregnant and intends to keep the baby. While puzzling the connection of Chelsea Doe's murder to the present case, they suggest that Landricks may have murdered her.Huang goes to the ME's office to inspect Chelsea Doe's body, and says that it is very possible that Tom Landricks has the mentality to kill. He suggests that the head and fingers were probably kept as souvenirs, and restrained her in such a way that she would fight back. The detectives find that a woman named Karen once lived at the Landricks address but went missing around the time Chelsea Doe's body was found, and go to speak to her grandmother. The grandmother says that Karen was the Landricks' nanny, but that she moved to Europe 2 years ago and has not contacted her since. She reveals that it was Tom Landricks who told her that Karen moved away, and Stabler finds a photograph of Karen wearing the bracelet which Sally had given him.Benson and Stabler go to talk to Sally, who is still at the ACS home, and Sally says that she took the bracelet from Jackie's drawer. Jackie admits that she found the bracelet in Karen's room after she 'left'. They decide to pull up the floor in what was Karen's room, and find her head and fingers.They go to speak to Tom Landricks in jail, and he suggests that the police set him up. The DNA from the remains found in the house match Karen's grandmother, and therefore it is probably Karen. Tom admits that he had to kill Karen to protect his family, because she threatened to tell the police about what he was doing.At the ACS home, Stabler goes to talk to Jackie, who is doing better and is no longer trapped under her father's spell. She tells him she no longer intends to keep the baby, as that is what her father would've wanted, and she doesn't want to do that anymore."

Inside, the video store clerk shoots the masked gunman who first started firing, but not before he has shot a little girl, who is lying unconscious next to her hysterical older sister.Detective Deuthorn arrives on the scene, and CSU walks him through what happened. The ski-mask wearing gunman, Eric Campbell, appears to have attempted to rob the store at gunpoint, when the little girl, Rebecca Kurtz, dropped a video and startled him, making him fire in her direction, shooting her and the man standing outside, before he himself is shot dead by the store clerk, Joey Field. Deuthorn talks to Field, who is shaken up, but Deuthorn tells him he did a good job.Rebecca Kurtz has been taken to the hospital and is put on life support and it is discovered that she has gonorrhea, at which point detectives Benson and Stabler are called onto the case.Munch and Tutuola talk to Missy Kurtz, Rebecca's teenage sister who was with her in the store. She is crying and distraught, but manages to tell them that their father works from home and spends a lot of time with Rebecca. She tells them also that she was adopted by the Kurtzes when she was twelve, and that her biological father was extremely abusive.Stabler talks to Mrs. Kurtz who reveals that Rebecca has been declared brain dead, while Benson talks to Mr. Kurtz, telling him that Rebecca was abused and asking for a DNA sample. He refuses and reacts very angrily to her suggestion, but Benson's instincts tell her that he is innocent. Tutuola, however, reveals that several years ago Missy filed a complaint of abuse against her adoptive father.Tutuola and Munch speak to the ACS caseworker who handled Missy, and she tells them that Missy was simply confused about the difference between a 'good touch' and a 'bad touch', after being abused since age five by her biological father. After some counselling, she recanted.After clearing Rebecca's piano and ballet teachers, Benson and Stabler go to her school and find out that Rebecca had suffered some incontinence, but that, as she was only six years old, it didn't really raise any alarm bells. Meanwhile, the Kurtzes have made it known that they intend to pull the plug on Rebecca, so that they can donate her organs.The detectives insist that they need time for a specialist to examine Rebecca to get all their evidence, before she is allowed to die. Cabot takes the matter to court, asking for a restraining order against the parents until the test can be done. The Kurtzes argue that as more time passes, Rebecca's organs are degenerating, and there is a dying little boy in Philadelphia who urgently needs a liver, to whom Rebecca is a match. The judge, however, agrees to the restraining order.After the examination is completed, it is confirmed that Rebecca was raped. Cabot wakes up a judge for the restraining order to be lifted, and Rebecca is taken off life support in time for her liver to be donated to the boy in Philadelphia. The Kurtz family agree to tests for gonorrhoea, and Mr. Kurtz comes back clean, however this could be because he was recently treated.Benson and Stabler talk to the Kurtzes' doctor, who says that he never treated Mr. Kurtz for gonorrhoea, but that he did treat Missy. Benson and Stabler confront Missy at her house, and she accuses her boyfriend of raping her and Rebecca and threatening to kill her if she ever told anyone. She reveals that her boyfriend is Joey Field, the clerk at the video store, and that he made her take Rebecca to the store the day of the shooting. She says that Field and Campbell, the masked shooter, were friends.Tutuola and Munch go to Eric Campbell's house and speak briefly to his drunkard father, who lets them search Eric's room. He was a new stereo and other expensive equipment, including a new answering machine, which has a message from Joey Field saved on it. The message appears to involve an arranged meeting, but is not explicit enough to amount to any kind of evidence. However, a technician at the lab has examined the gunshot residue pattern on Rebecca's shirt and it reveals that Campbell moved closer to Rebecca in order to shoot her (presumably after his first shot missed and hit the man outside the store).Benson and Stabler go to Joey Field's house and lure him outside (so they can arrest him without a warrant) by saying he is going to win an award for his heroism at the video store. It turns out that Field's father is a high profile lawyer, who refuses to let his son cooperate with the police. At arraignment, it appears as though Field Snr. knows the judge very well, but this does him no favours as Joey is remanded without bail.Missy's lawyer appeals to Donnelly and Cabot for her to have immunity if she agrees to testify against Joey, so that she won't be prosecuted for taking her sister to the store. Donnelly agrees. Meanwhile, the detectives are having trouble finding any helpful witnesses from the video store, while Malcolm Field begins to swamp Cabot with useless motions (such as to exclude the answering machine as evidence), and calls Deuthorn to testify that Joey was a hero.Munch and Tutuola search the Fields' residence, and find a shocking tape. The detectives and Cabot view it and find that it is a video of Rebecca Kurtz, apparently drugged, and Joey Field and Missy Kurtz abusing her together. They realise that the abuse and the killing were all Missy's idea, but there's nothing they can do now that she has immunity from prosecution.Cabot and Cregan go to speak with Joey Field in prison, but he refuses to betray Missy. They reveal that his test for gonorrhoea was negative, meaning that Missy must be cheating on him, and got the disease from someone else, then gave it to Rebecca. Joey finally admits that everything was Missy's idea, and that she had planned the killing to look like a robbery gone wrong (Eric wasn't aware that as part of the plan, he too would be killed) and asked him to participate. He reveals that while Rebecca was usually drugged during the abuse, she had woken up one time and threatened to tell her parents, and that is why Missy decided to kill her.Cabot is determined to find a way to break Missy's immunity, studying through the case law. Donnelly tells her that DA Branch okayed the death penalty for Joey, and to give up, because there was no way to get Missy for the crime. Cabot does, however, come up with a plan, which involves Malcolm Field helping her, in exchange for Joey's death penalty coming off the table.Field argues, in front of Judge Petrovsky, that the ADA can't put Missy on the stand to testify against Joey, because they know that what she is saying is perjury, but by not putting Missy on the stand, Joey is denied his constitutional right to confront his accuser. Petrovsky agrees, and voids the immunity. Petrovsky knows that the whole thing was Cabot's idea, and is not happy with her. She tells Cabot that she had better have all the evidence ready to convict Missy by tomorrow.Missy is arrested, and the Kurtzes storm into the station, furious. The detectives show them the video, and although they are horrified, they intend to stand by Missy, because they don't want to lose another daughter. When the detectives ask where Missy could possibly have gotten the money to pay off Eric Campbell, they refuse to help.Missy refuses to cooperate with the detectives or Cabot, and her lawyer argues that with her childhood history, a jury will not convict her. Huang talks to Missy, and determines that she is a sociopath. She has no feelings for Rebecca or the Kurtzes, and feels no guilt. He says that by the time the Kurtzes adopted Missy, the damage was probably already done.Munch and Tutuola go over the things they found in Eric Campbell's room, and find a pawn ticket from a few days before the murder. The pawn shop owner shows them the gold locket which he sold, inscribed with the words 'To Missy, love Mum and Dad'.In a final meeting with Missy, she appears cocky, confident that she will not be convicted. Cabot sets her straight- they have the evidence, and she will be convicted and executed. Missy is cold and has no remorse. ""You can't kill me,"" she says. ""I'm already dead.""Outside the courthouse, Mr. Kurtz pleads with Cabot to take away Missy's death penalty, which she cannot do."

Campbell|4|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/risk-219153/recap|http://www.tv.com|A woman runs out of her apartment, holding her baby and screaming that he is not breathing. Benson and Stabler are called to the hospital, where they are told that the baby is suffering a cocaine overdose. The mother denies giving her baby the coke, and the doctor is able to tell them that the drug seems to have been mixed in with the baby formula. The mother admits that she borrowed a can of formula from a couple whose apartment she cleans.Benson and Stabler rush to the home of the Pfeiffers, who have a baby boy, and take away all the other cans of the baby formula for testing, as well as seizing those from the market where the Pfeiffers bought them. The lab reveals that one of the cans from the Pfeiffers' apartment contains 90% liquid cocaine, and that the baby formula was drained from the can before it was filled with the drug. None of the other cans, or the ones from the market, are tainted.The FDA issues a recall of all the baby food of that brand, while the detectives are able to determine that the tainted cans came, not from the company's American plant, but from Mexico. A little more digging reveals that Derek Pfeiffer was bankrupt, until recently, when he mysteriously was able to pay off all his debts. They then get a message that the baby suffering from an overdose has died.Munch and Tutuola go to speak to Derek Pfeiffer, who admits he was in Mexico, but to see a business client (he is some sort of Wall Street/investments person). Munch and Tutuola tell him to go with them to the police station, but as they are putting him in a car outside the building, internal affairs officers take him into their car. One of the officers, Tucker, tells them that Cregan signed off on it, and that he told them where to find the detectives.Cregan is furious when he hears what Tucker said, as he by no means gave IA the okay to take Pfeiffer. They storm into internal affairs where Cregan loses his temper. He instructs Stabler to try and find out what interest IA have in the case and tells him to pick up Derek Pfeiffer again, since IA has released him. When Benson and Stabler go to Pfeiffer's office, they find police officers already there, and find Pfeiffer strangled with a cord in the bathrooms on his floor.Munch and Tutuola speak to Keith Gerard, Pfeiffer's immediate boss, who tells them that the security in the building should not have allowed this to happen. Meanwhile, Benson and Stabler talk to Mrs. Pfeiffer who says that she knows nothing about her husband's work, nor how he found the money to pay off their debts. The detectives offer her protection, but she says she will take her son and go to stay with her sister. She admits, nervously, that a man came to the door, asking for the formula, and showed her a police badge.Tucker hears that SVU are still investigating the case and comes to speak to Cregan. He admits that several undercover operations aimed at cracking the baby formula ring have failed, and a dirty cop is suspected. Cregan insists that it remains SVU's case, and that their detectives will handle the undercover work.Stabler is chosen to go undercover as he looks like the 'clean-cut, corporate type.' He goes to a bar where they suspect Derek did his business, and (with Benson inside the bar as backup), he allows the barman to see that he has some cocaine with him. The barman refers him to another man sitting at the end of the bar, whom Stabler follows into the bathroom, where he is roughed up a little, then made an offer. They arrange to meet at a dock to do business.At the dock, another man shows up. Stabler is searched, then shown some cocaine which the two men offer to supply to him to sell at his office building. When he agrees to the deal, one of the men pulls out a gold shield and bundles him into the car and they drive away. Munch, Cregan, Benson and Tutuola, who are in other cars as backup, follow. The car stops, and Stabler is taken out and beaten up, so that the man with the badge can show he is 'top dog'. The man tells Stabler his name is Kendall and that Stabler now has to help them smuggle drugs from Mexico. They then drive away and leave Stabler there.Back at the station, the detectives look at Kendall's record. He is a decorated detective, who seems to have gone off the rails after a bad shooting incident. Stabler meets with Kendall again, in a restaurant, and they discuss money. Kendall reveals that he will have to take Stabler's demands to his boss, and that he will get back to him.Kendall calls Stabler with the mission; to find a reason to go to Mexico for business, and pick up some tiles made with cocaine, his cover story being that he is re-tiling his kitchen. Since Mexico is out of their jurisdiction, someone else is to pick up the tiles and they will then be delivered to Stabler's undercover house in Queens.The tiles are delivered by Munch, pretending to be a delivery man, and Stabler is just about to hand them over to Kendall when Benson comes out of the house, posing as Stabler's wife. As the delivery truck comes back towards the house, Kendall realises it is a sting and runs. Stabler follows him and draws his gun and when Kendall turns his gun on him he is forced to shoot him dead. IAB investigate the shooting and Tucker places Stabler on modified assignment until they sort things out- he is confined to the office and cannot arrest or interrogate anyone. Meanwhile, DNA from the cord which was used to kill Derek Pfeiffer is a match to Kendall, who was probably working on a higher-up dealer's orders.The detectives discover that when Derek Pfeiffer flew to Mexico, his wife and the baby also flew there, but on a different airline. They realise that Mrs. Pfeiffer was the mule, as no one would suspect a mother carrying cans of baby formula.Benson and Cregan (since Stabler cannot leave the office) go to speak again with Pfeiffer's boss, Keith Gerard, about whether Pfeiffer's trips to Mexico were for legitimate business. He says that they were, but reveals that the Pfeiffers did not have children. Cregan speculates that whoever payed the Pfeiffers to smuggle drugs, probably has a ring of mothers with babies doing the same thing.Benson and Cregan then go to Staten Island, to speak to Mrs. Pfeiffer at her sister's house. They can hear the baby crying, and find a window broken, and so they break the door open. They find the baby distressed but unharmed, and find Mrs. Pfeiffer and her sister shot dead in the kitchen. They discover that the baby is Mrs. Pfeiffer's nephew, and that Mrs. Pfeiffer was planning a one-way trip to Brazil to avoid prosecution.The detectives begin tracking down similar cases where parents of babies have been killed execution-style. Stabler becomes very frustrated by this task, and is busy yelling at Munch when Kathy comes in to bring him something to eat.Cregan and Benson are called to a house in Queens were there has just been a murder which fits the pattern they are looking at- new parents shot dead. There appear to be no signs of forced entry. They discover that the father was a landscaper for Keith Gerard, and realise that he is in charge of the smuggling ring and has probably ordered the killings of all the parents in the ring so there are no witnesses against him.Benson and Cregan go to Gerard's office, where his secretary tells them that he is down in the corporate day care centre. They catch him walking out with a mother with a baby, and when Gerard sees them, he pulls a gun on the mother and holds her and her baby as a shield. Cregan and Benson lower their weapons, as if to let Gerard get away. He pushes the mother and her baby away and runs, but is stopped by Tutuola, who had snuck up behind him. They arrest him for murder.Cregan gives Stabler his gun and badge back, and says that he made the trouble with IAB over the shooting go away. Stabler realises that Cregan must have pulled some pretty big strings to make it happen so fast.Benson comes in and tells Stabler that they found ten other mothers involved in the smuggling ring, who Gerard probably would have killed. Stabler is clearly still distressed over the shooting, and Benson asks if he has spoken to a shrink about it yet. He says no, and asks whether it helped her to talk to a shrink after she shot a perp. She says it didn't help much.

Gage & Ruth Fletcher|4|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/mercy-225746/recap|http://www.tv.com|"A cooler containing a dead one-month old infant girl is found in the Hudson River near Battery Park.  A plastic bag tied to the cooler handle had contained weights, which broke through the bag and allowed the cooler to float to the surface. Warner determines that the infant died only a day ago of a lethal dose of tricyclic antidepressants, which aren't prescribed to nursing mothers. But in all other respects this child had been well cared for, so she wasn't a throwaway.Algae, sodium hypochlorite, and a partial logo on the bag narrow down the geographic area where the cooler was placed into the river. Hudson University is in that area. For lack of any other profile, SVU initially seeks out college students away from home who'd faced an unplanned pregnancy.  When the university medical center insists on a subpoena before it will identify students who'd had pregnancy tests there, Elliot and Olivia seek one from Alex Cabot. Alex doesn't think they have grounds for it, but reluctantly agrees to ask her boss. To her surprise, SVU Bureau Chief Elizabeth Donnelly insists on getting the subpoena. Donnelly is ends-justify-the-means incensed that this mother didn't make use of the state's hard-won Baby Safe Haven law to give up her child safely, without fear of prosecution.  A judge issues the subpoena, and the detectives -- Munch unwillingly -- visit the named students to ask about their pregnancies.Several invasions of privacy later, Warner determines that the dead infant had Tay-Sachs disease. This was a mercy killing. A medical researcher tells Elliot and Olivia that symptoms the parents would have noticed wouldn't have appeared for about six months. However, the eye discoloration of Tay-Sachs is visible very soon after birth. Any pediatrician would have seen it during a well-baby checkup. Fortunately the disease is rare, so much so that there's only one support group in the area.Elliot and Olivia visit the support group and tell the rabbi they're looking for a local couple with a one-month-old child. The rabbi remembers one woman from Manhattan who had attended recently. She came only once and had been referred by her child's pediatrician, Dr. Judah Platner. The doctor is a member of the rabbi's congregation.Dr. Platner refuses to reveal any information about the woman. A check with the Vital Statistics Bureau reveals that the previous week, Platner had signed a death certificate for a Sarah Brown, who died at one month of age from asphyhxiation pneumonia. Elliot and Olivia visit the bereaved parents, Daniel and Andrea Brown. Olivia asks to use the bathroom, and finds in the trash an empty bottle of the adult antidepressant Imipramine -- prescribed for Andrea Brown the previous week by Dr. Platner.Warner confirms that Imipramine is the tricyclic that killed Sarah Brown. Alex gets a warrant for the discarded prescription bottle, which in turn is sufficient grounds for opening Sarah's grave. The Browns buried an empty casket. Andrea Brown and Dr. Platner are both brought in for questioning.  A DNA test confirms the dead infant was Sarah Brown. Andrea says she acted alone in killing her daughter, and is charged with murder. Platner is charged with supplying the murder weapon, the antidepressant. The doctor staunchly defends his actions. After watching countless other children die terrible deaths, in Sarah's case at least he was able to do something before she suffered. Dr. Platner testifies that he was Andrea's pediatrician from the day she was born, and sort of a surrogate father after her own father died. When he told her and Daniel that Sarah had Tay-Sachs disease, they felt very guilty over never being tested themselves. He also says both of them wanted to end Sarah's suffering, though he acknowledges having spoken directly only to Andrea about it. She was determined to euthanize Sarah with or without Dr. Platner's help. So he helped her in order to make things as painless as possible for both of them.Andrea testifies she had acted alone in ending Sarah's life, saying she didn't want her husband to be the one who did it. Later, Alex sees the Browns and Platner arguing outside the courtroom. Platner's attorney tells Alex his client wants to make a deal. Baffled by Platner's suddenly throwing in the towel, Alex and her boss say they'll sleep on it. Alex tells the detectives that Platner had seemed surprised when Andrea testified she'd acted alone. Munch wonders why the Browns, who must have known the risk of Tay-Sachs, weren't tested for the gene before they married. Answer: There had been no need for testing if Daniel Brown wasn't born Jewish. Confronted with a court order for a DNA sample from him, Daniel acknowledges that he's Jewish by conversion, and that he's not Sarah's biological father. He'd suspected an affair when Sarah was diagnosed, but he didn't know for certain until Andrea told him following her arrest.In her closing argument to the jury, Andrea's attorney portrays her client as a loving mother who'd done what she did solely to spare Sarah a life of horrible agony.  She asks the jurors to ask themselves, ""If this were my child, what would I do?""Alex portrays Andrea as a self-centered woman who sought to conceal her infidelity by eliminating the proof of it. She didn't tell her husband he wasn't her child's father, once she knew.  She didn't tell Sarah's father he had a child. She pressured Dr. Platner to engage in criminal conduct to help her end Sarah's life. Since Sarah had not yet begun showing noticeable signs of Tay-Sachs, the longer she lived, the more likely someone was likely to find out the truth. This was no mercy killing, but a clear-cut case of murder. The jury convicts Andrea Brown of second-degree murder, which carries 25 years to life. Munch, who's against euthanizing children, congratulates Alex on her victory. Alex doesn't feel victorious, saying she won only by portraying Andrea as a whore. She asks Munch the defense's question:  ""If it had been your child, what would you have done?"" Munch answers, ""Whatever I could."""

Suicide was initially determined to be the cause of death, but the sexually related bruising causes them to question whether she had been pushed.The woman is identified as a film student, Carmen Trancoso. Her face had been destroyed by the fall, so the detectives initially identifier her as Anna Rivera, a former maid at the Lamerly's penthouse. The detectives learn Carmen had been dating the Lamerly's son, Drew, but the relationship had gotten too intense. Drew broke it off with her and Carmen began to stalk him. Benson and Stabler visit the attorneys who were representing Carmen, who was trying to sue Drew for rape. However, Drew is prepared with his lawyer Lorna Scarry, who refutes Carmen's claim. As they dig into Drew's past, it is revealed he had been expelled from a private school. The detectives learn Drew's prom date, Jenny White, also claims Drew had raped her. Jenny had been a prostitute at the time and is now married to a rich and powerful man. Because of this, she hesitates to come forward. Then investigators now believe Carmen did not jump – she had been pushed. Drew claims the family's head of security, Tom Paysen, had killed Carmen.The detectives bring Drew in for an evaluation by Dr. Huang and a lie detector test, but he almost does too well on it. Then finally a break, a rare material traced to a jacket in his closet is found on the victim. Drew is placed under arrest. Scarry attempts to get Cabot to cut a deal. When that doesn't work, she claims he is not guilty by virtue of diminished capacity because his father was highly abusive. Drew's grandmother, Candace, tries to make the case on the stand, but Cabot claims in the abuse from his father never came up in Drew's polygraph. The judge rules against Cabot and allows the testimony. Since it was privileged information, Cabot refuses to be defeated.The detectives go to Jenny White Rochester and convince her to testify. They now realize it was Drew's grandmother, who was the ringleader, and not his father.  Candace had groomed Drew to be the violent man that he is. Candace is now in as much trouble as her grandson, whose defense has been rejected by the court.

Firefighters break down the door and find food burning on the stove, a frightened six-year-old boy named Mikey, and his badly injured mother. The mother had also been raped and sodomized. Barely alive when the fire department arrived, she dies at the hospital during surgery.   The mother's purse and all other identifying information were taken by her attacker. A urine stain on the hallway carpet outside the bedroom suggests that Mikey witnessed the assault, and was so terrified by what he saw that he wet his pants.The apartment landlord identifies the mother as Dana McGuire. She had moved in a month ago, paying  cash up front for three months. Her driver's license had listed an upscale Central Park address.Dana McGuire is alive and well at the address on the license. Her purse had been stolen in a mugging some time before. The mugger, who's serving six months at Rikers, met ""Dana"" in a diner and gave her the license after she told him she couldn't find work because she had no ID. He knew her as Jill, and her son as Tommy. Warner determines that Jill probably hadn't been able to have children, and that Tommy definitely isn't her biological child. Tommy likes to draw, and he draws pictures of Jill's murder and of himself holding hands with Olivia. Olivia tries to draw him out about what happened to Jill. He reaches for her cell phone, and she gives it to him. He dials 911. Olivia asks Tommy if he knows his home number, and he tosses the phone down on the table. When she asks if he knows any other numbers, such as those one might call in an emergency, he dials the Domestic Violence Hotline.A compassionate hotline worker identifies Jill as Jill Hoffman, and expresses her disgust that Jill's husband ""finally did it."" Dan Hoffman is a violent, abusive monster who completely isolated Jill from the world. After three weeks at a safe house, Jill returned home long enough to get Tommy. But then the domestic violence workers couldn't shelter her, because as Tommy's stepmother she had no legal right to take the boy from his father. They did find her a pro bono attorney to help her fight for legal custody.The attorney tells Elliot and Olivia that Dan started abusing Jill shortly after their wedding two years ago.  Kim, Dan's first wife and Tommy's biological mother, had left a year before that; Dan probably abused her too. Dan had psychologically terrorized his son, but hadn't laid a hand on him -- yet. Jill had known that Dan's crossing that line was only a matter of time  She'd never made a domestic violence complaint because her husband is Mr. Pillar-of-the-Community in their exclusive small town of Rye. Who would believe he's a batterer?Tommy tells Olivia that he and Jill had run away from his father. Jill was going to find them a new home, someplace far away where his father wouldn't find them. Just as Tommy is going to talk about Jill's murder, Dan Hoffman storms in. Tommy is clearly terrified, but he's been medically cleared and released to the custody of his father.Dan's alibi for the night of Jill's murder is being at a business association dinner dance. The event was held at a place only five minutes from Jill's apartment. Several attendees confirm that Dan was there. They also remember that he disappeared for about 45 minutes during the evening, then reappeared.Alex Cabot tries, unsuccessfully, to get court permission for George Huang to interview Tommy. To prove he's not the monster the police think he is, Dan submits to a police interview. He plays the loving father and grieving widower only too well for Elliot and Olivia's taste, having the right answer for every question they ask. When Olivia tells him she doesn't buy his act, his good-guy mask slips just a bit as he replies, ""You wouldn't dare talk to me that way if you didn't have that badge and gun.""Munch finds a new checking account in the name of Dana McGuire, but it's actually Jill's. She had deposited some paychecks from Benny's Topless into the account. Another Benny's entertainer tells Elliot and Olivia that although Jill was a lousy dancer, she was hired because she looked like ""Susie Homemaker."" Many of  Benny's customers are commuters who stop in before heading home to the suburbs. Jill quit in a panic the previous week, after seeing someone from her former hometown in the crowd one night.  The credit card receipts from that night lead to a Mr. Rizzo, from Rye. To keep his wife from finding out he's not working heavy overtime, he gladly reveals that he told Dan Hoffman about the Benny's stripper who looked exactly like Jill. Rizzo figured it was a great laugh.Elliot and Olivia talk to Alex Cabot, pointing out that once Dan knew where Jill worked, all he had to do was follow her home. Their circumstantial information is enough for an arrest, but Dan's a very handsome, successful, charismatic man, fully capable of charming a grand jury into not indicting him. Therefore Alex obtains a ""silent indictment"", which gets Dan indicted and arrested for Jill's murder, without giving him an opportunity to testify before the grand jury. The case against Dan takes a major bad turn when the judge won't allow the domestic violence workers to testify that Jill told hem she was being abused. Tommy's testimony would convict his father, but SVU is still barred from talking to the boy. Alex asks about Kim Hoffman, who as Tommy's biological mother has every right to talk to him. Elliot replies that SVU hasn't been able to find her. Captain Cragen tells the detectives to find someone who'd known Kim.Allen Wheaten, the Hoffmans' longtime neighbor, knew Kim was being physically abused because he'd seen the injuries. He believes Dan murdered Kim, because late one night he saw a van pull into the Hoffmans' driveway. Someone filled the van with garbage bags and drove off. The next day, Kim was gone. Wheaten contacted the Rye police with the van's license plate number and his suspicion that Kim was murdered. The van belonged to a Dawn Trent, a soccer mom from Port Chester who said she'd been delivering Girl Scout cookies. Case closed.Dawn Trent tells Elliot that she had helped Kim escape that night from her abusive situation. Kim didn't take Tommy with her then because Dan was on the verge of killing her; she had to leave fast. She hoped to return for her son once she was settled elsewhere. Dawn belongs to a group which rescues domestic violence victims and passes them from one person to another, eventually resettling them far away from their abusers. All any rescuer knows is the next link in the chain.  Elliot follows the chain of Kim's rescuers, locates Kim and tells her everything that's happened. She tearfully tells him she had gone back for Tommy, only to see him happily playing on the front lawn with Jill and calling her ""Mommy."" Kim then thought he was better off there, because what did she have to offer him. Elliot persuades her to come back for Tommy's sake. If she doesn't, Dan will be acquitted of Jill's murder; and Tommy will be returned to his father.At the courthouse where Dan's trial is in progress, Kim talks to Tommy in the hallway. The bond between mother and son is reestablished. When Tommy is called to testify, he and his mother walk into the courtroom together. On the witness stand Tommy is too terrified of his father to speak, and the judge allows him to step down without testifying. As Alex leads Tommy past the defense table to leave, Dan flashes him a big smile and says, ""I love you, son."" Tommy looks at his mother sitting nearby, then quietly says to his father, ""You killed Jill."" Dan's lawyer immediately asks for a mistrial, as the judge calls for order in the court among the murmuring observers. Dan's good-guy mask slips off as he coldly says, ""Tommy, you listen to me. Don't do this."" Tommy turns to Alex and says, ""I'm ready. I can do this now.""Dan Hoffman can only watch in silent, seething rage as Tommy returns to the witness stand. As Tommy sits down, he glares at his father with a steely, righteous defiance that not even Dan's most violent abusive fury will shake."

The umbilical cord was tied off with dental floss, suggesting a home birth. Freshly laid maggots indicate the body had been dumped no more than three hours before.Elliot and Olivia canvass the immediate neighborhood and locate expectant mother Brianna Morris. Her landlord tells them that even when Morris' condition clearly showed, she still denied being pregnant. They find her dead in her bedroom, delivered of her child. Someone else dumped the baby.A neighbor heard someone knock at Morris' door early that morning, then nothing. Prescription prenatal vitamins lead to obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Curtis. He tells Elliot and Olivia that while Morris had been eight months along, she had been his patient for only the past three. Although Morris underwent every medical test in the book, she had been very emotionally detached from her pregnancy.  A man named Ron Wolcott paid the doctor's bills, except for the latest one on which the credit card was declined.Ron Wolcott and his wife Kelly were to have adopted Morris' baby, after trying unsuccessfully for ten years to have a child of their own. Ron, who works at a food flavoring institute, says his credit card was declined because it was maxed out. The adoption was privately arranged by Marcy Cochran, the wife of one of Ron's colleagues. She does volunteer work, and Morris had called her hotline.Cochran says that Morris had been considering suicide after finding out she was pregnant. Her own life was a wreck, and she feared that her child's would be no better. The father was ""the man of her dreams"", until she discovered the phone number he gave her was fake. Cochran had taken a special interest in Morris, talking with her on the phone every night. During their last call four days ago, they had a fight. Cochran had told her husband, in confidence, that Morris had changed her mind about giving up her baby.  Mr. Cochran then told Ron Wolcott.Warner determines that the baby bled to death through her umbilical cord. The cord wasn't tied off until after she had lost over half her blood.  Morris had been injected with drugs to paralyze her first, then to induce labor. After the birth, she was suffocated to death.Elliot and Olivia confront Wolcott, a chemist, at his workplace. He admits he stopped paying Morris' medical bills, to convince her to go through with the adoption. SVU obtains a search warrant for the Wolcotts' home, where Kelly Wolcott says her husband hadn't told her that Morris had changed her mind. A small case of pharmaceuticals is found in the kitchen. As the search continues, new SVU prosecutor Casey Novak arrives. A former white-collar prosecutor, Novak is accustomed to being very hands-on with her cases and visiting crime scenes herself.Novak's visit to Morris' apartment turns up library books on child care, and another title ""Skin Diseases of the Elderly."" Library staff remembers Morris, who had been interested in a dermatologist named Archibald Newlands and how to file a paternity suit.Dr. Newlands tells Elliot and Olivia that Morris, whom he'd never seen before, came to his office a week ago and made a huge scene. Apparently he bore a strong resemblance to an ex-boyfriend. His wife, also a dermatologist and his business partner, vouches for his alibi the day of Morris' death. He volunteers to take a paternity test.Ron Wolcott's alibi for the day of Morris' murder is verified. The pharmaceuticals found in his home were from a sales representative, and none of them could make the drugs used on Morris. The paternity test reveals that Newlands isn't the father of Morris' baby. However, the test has cleared a cold case.Newlands is brought in for raping young Molly Stratton some five years before. He denies being a pedophile. Novak clashes with Elliot and Olivia over their interrogation of Newlands, because the statute of limitations on the crime expired three months ago. In hopes of locating other victims, the detectives talk to the now 11-year-old Stratton. She remembers that her rapist had used honey during his attack.SVU finds another, recent young victim of a rapist who used honey. Against Cragen's advice, Novak insists on bringing in Newlands for a lineup. Novak then learns firsthand just how ugly and emotionally draining sex crimes can be. Olivia reassures her that everyone thinks at first that they can't handle it.Novak visits Mrs. Newlands, who stands by her husband until told that his DNA was found in the earlier victim. Archibald Newlands fails to appear at his trial, and his attorney is at a loss to explain his client's absence. Newlands is later found at his home, shot in the back of the head.Cragen wonders if the wronged Mrs. Newlands killed her husband, when he receives word that six-year-old Courtney Jones went missing from a public park early that morning.  Although his home is near the crime scene, Archibald Newlands was killed at about the same time Jones disappeared. A honey stirrer is found in a nearby trash can. While performing the autopsy on Newlands' body, Warner finds a plastic tube of blood in his upper arm. He was the father of Morris' baby, but he wasn't the Honey Rapist. He put the tube with someone else's blood in his arm to beat the paternity test. Unfortunately for him, that someone else was a previously unidentified child rapist.The real Honey Rapist must be one of Newlands' patients, who now feels footloose and fancy-free. To keep everyone thinking the Rapist is dead, he'll have to kill Courtney Jones. Mrs. Newlands checks their patient lists, and finds that they drew blood from only one male patient during the timeframe in question.SVU raids the home of Peter Nestler. He isn't there, but they find jars of honey and stacks of child pornography. Novak arrives with a search warrant, and to see if she's really cut out to handle sex crimes. She sees fishing gear in a closet and realizes that Nestler is a saltwater fisherman. Olivia finds a framed newspaper photo of Nestler posing on his boat, the Honey Do, at City Island Marina.The three of them go to the marina and spot Nestler headed for his boat slip, wheeling a large portable cooler. When Elliot and Olivia give chase, he drops the cooler and runs. Elliot catches up with Nestler and knocks him into the water, while Olivia continues on to search the boat. Back down the pier, Novak checks the cooler and finds Courtney Jones inside, unconscious but alive.Later, Novak asks Arthur Branch to take her off Special Victims. Although she slam-dunked her first case, she's still an emotional train wreck from Courtney Jones' ordeal. Branch says that he'd had his eye on Novak for SVU prosecutor when she was still in the white-collar crime division. The Jones case proved that he made the right choice for the job; and while Novak may not want it now, eventually she will."

Sarah complains to Veronica that Lucy is unmanageable because Mrs. Prichard will not allow discipline to stifle the young girl's ""creativity."" Veronica, who is a more experienced nanny, offers to show her how to handle Lucy, but when Sarah calls for Lucy to come, there's no answer. Lucy has disappeared.A uniform cop greets Stabler at the scene, and tells him that one of the nannies had noticed a ""creepy"" guy hanging around, and the uni thought SVU would like to get a jump on things if this turned out to be a pedophile snatch. Cragen arrives and says since Benson is testifying on another case Stabler will be working with him for the duration. As they walk the scene, Stabler notices something in the bushes. Yelling for Cragen to call a bus, he picks up an unconscious Lucy and starts heading for the street, as he murmurs to Lucy to ""stay with me"" and ""it's going to be all right.""Stabler speaks with Dr. Morella at the hospital. A CT scan had indicated Lucy had an intracranial bleed, but no fracture, although she did have a cut on the back of her head.  Lucy was rushed to surgery to try to relieve the pressure on her brain before a rape kit could be done. However, a quick Lumi-Light revealed no evidence of semen and her clothing was intact. Cragen arrives on the ward and says he's spoken with the mother who works in advertising, so it may take her a while to get to the hospital. Lucy's father had died last year from a heart attack. Stabler says, ""Hits just keep coming, huh?"" With no family to interview, the detectives turn to the nannies.Stabler and Cragen interview Sarah in one of the hospital's stairwells. Sarah has never seen the creepy guy Veronica saw, and she has never seen anyone she doesn't know. It's always the same people. While Sarah lists the different places to which she takes Lucy, Evelyn Prichard arrives.  Distraught, she asks how Sarah could let this happen and then collapses and weeps on Stabler's chest after Cragen takes Sarah away, and asks why God is punishing her. Stabler suggests she see the hospital chaplain.Outside the chapel, Cragen says he will stay with Evelyn and Stabler should interview Veronica Nash to see if she can describe the creepy guy in the park. Stabler interviews Veronica at her charge's home. She takes pleasure in telling him that Sarah is just a babysitter and Veronica, as a certified nanny, would not have found herself in similar circumstances. She describes the man in the park as a ""white guy, mid-40s, short dark hair, very stocky."" She originally thought he was a father who wanted candid shots of his child. Stabler takes her back to the park so she can show him the location where the man had been shooting, and then sends her to the precinct to work with a sketch artist. Stabler and Siper examine the scene, and Stabler finds an empty film box.Back at the precinct, Dr. Huang points out nowadays it is very unusual for a pedophile to use film. Most have gone digital to avoid being reported when they send the film to be developed, which might indicate the perpetrator is a risk-taker. Cragen walks in with a match for the fingerprints on the film box: Dennis Papillion, who works at a local drug store.At the Sav-Mart on Broadway, Cragen and Stabler find out Papillion works in Photo Finishing. Because he picks up the film to sell it to the customers, the fingerprint is easily explained and he has an iron-clad alibi: he has been in the store since it opened, under surveillance by a security camera. He is, however, able to identify the park photographer for them, Ronny Ickles.Ickles is very upset to find himself in an interrogation room as an accused pedophile. He claims he is a PI, but is unable to produce a license. Although it was a legitimate job, he had left the scene because he knew his client wouldn't like for him to get involved. Cragen threatens him with prison, and Ickles reveals a rich man named David Jeffries paid him to spy on his nanny - to see how his son was treated when he wasn't around.Stabler is at a board sorting the PI's pictures when Benson walks in with the rest of the photos. Cragen comes in and says Jeffries has confirmed Ickles story. Stabler tries to make sense of the photos, but something doesn't add up. No one is anywhere near Lucy around the time of her disappearance. Cragen says maybe there is no crime; maybe this was an accident. Stabler adds kids fall down all the time and get hurt, but they don't end up in the hospital in surgery. Olivia gets a call from the hospital and tells Stabler that Lucy's doctor wants to see him.Stabler goes to the hospital. Dr. Morella says Lucy is out of surgery, but she's still unconscious. Lucy has bilateral subdural hematomas with retinal shearing. Stabler says Shaken Baby Syndrome, and Morella agrees. It's hard to say what Lucy's chances are. Even if she recovers, she will probably have permanent brain damage. Stabler asks if she's sure about the diagnosis, and Morella says she is, ""Someone shook Lucy so hard it damn near killed her.""Dr. Warner reviews Shaken Baby Syndrome with Stabler and Novak at the precinct. Lucy's injuries fall into the constellation of injuries that make up the syndrome. She will have no problem testifying that this is the only possible cause of Lucy's injuries.  In addition to the bilateral hematomas and the retinal shearing, she has compression fractures of the ribs from where the perpetrator grabbed her. Novak can't understand how no one noticed this at the playground. Warner says, due to the amount of bleeding, somebody shook Lucy between 12 and 48 hours before her collapse. Lucy would have been lethargic, sleepy, and maybe even vomiting. Novak says that means the perp could be anyone who had contact with Lucy in the last three days.Stabler goes back to interview Evelyn at the hospital. She and Sarah are the only adults in contact with Lucy; she hasn't dated anyone since her husband died. She had worked late on Monday because she needs all the overtime she can get. She wishes she could afford someone more qualified than Sarah, but she can't, even working overtime. She says she has caught Sarah yelling at Lucy, but if she had ever seen her hit her daughter then Sarah would have been fired immediately. Stabler asks if she's seen any marks on Lucy. Evelyn says only a few, but Sarah always has a good explanation like a fall or another child hit her at the playground. She goes quiet as the implication hits her.Stabler and Sarah talk at the precinct. Stabler is very sympathetic, and draws out Sarah's complaints about her work hours, low pay, and what a horrible child Lucy is. She tells him Lucy threw a toy at Sarah a couple of months ago and she spanked her. Sarah swears she did not cause Lucy to be hospitalized. Stabler points out she was the only adult who had been with Lucy on both Monday and Tuesday. Sarah tells him Lucy falls down a lot, but Stabler says the falls don't explain the injuries. Stabler asks if she is willing to take a polygraph. She says she isn't sure because she is afraid. Stabler urges her to come clean now before it's too late. Sarah then confesses to taking $5 to $10 at a time from Evelyn's purse because she is paid so little and works so hard, and this causes her to be angry.Stabler tells Novak his gut tells him that Sarah is innocent. Novak tells him his gut is inadmissible. Besides, she fits Huang's profile, perhaps she is just a clever sociopath. Cragen walks into the squad room saying he hates to rain on Stabler's parade, but he just got a call from Ian Felson at the Tribune. Felson has an eye witness who says Sarah abused Lucy.Stabler tracks down Felson, who gives up his source for an exclusive on the arrest. It turns out that Veronica Nash left some things out of her original interview. Back at Nash's place of employment, her superior attitude is still firmly in place as she points out that Stabler didn't ask, so she didn't volunteer the information because she thought it was the creepy guy who'd attacked Lucy. Now she says Lucy is willful and defiant and Sarah is unable to control her, which makes her frustrated and abusive toward her daughter. When asked for a specific incident, she tells them about a trip to a museum where Lucy was out of control, staff had complained, and Sarah had belted her across the face.At the Children's Museum, Stabler discovers it was Veronica who had hit Lucy, and not Sarah. Angry, Stabler returns to a defiant and unapologetic Nash, who tells him that Lucy needs discipline. Unfortunately, she also has an airtight alibi for the relevant time period, so the most they can charge her with is assault. Cragen points out the papers will crucify her and she'll lose her job. That's something. Munch walks in with Sarah's polygraph results; she had passed. This leaves only one suspect.Stabler returns to the hospital to talk to Evelyn again. With no one but herself left as a suspect, Evelyn finally confesses to having a boyfriend. Lucy was with him for 20 minutes on Sunday night after she had sent the sitter home, but she had to go out unexpectedly. She admits that was reluctant to confess to the affair because the man is married.Stabler discusses the case with Cragen and Huang. Evelyn has been having an affair with her boss, Drew Farmer, for the last couple months, which explains all of Evelyn's overtime. Cragen wonders why it happened if Evelyn was gone such a short time. Huang says the sound of a baby screaming can trigger an extreme stress response in some people and it doesn't take much time at all. He postulates that possibly Farmer was just trying to make her be quiet.Drew Farmer is brought to the station, where he maintains that Evelyn is just an employee. Stabler trips him up, and Fuller admits he was at Evelyn apartment on Sunday night, but he won't go beyond that. Farmer says, ""Look, if my wife finds out, she will cut my balls off!"" Stabler counters, ""You keep jerking me around, criminal court's gonna do a lot worse to you!"" Farmer swears he did nothing to Lucy. He finally admits she wouldn't stop crying, but when he picked her up she vomited on his jacket. He didn't want to spoil the mood, so he didn't tell Evelyn. Stabler becomes more and more frustrated because he feels he is failing Lucy. She can't speak, but every adult in her life is lying their asses off. Cragen decides to go back to the medical evidence and let it tell the story.Dr. Warner sets up a timeline with Lucy's physical symptoms and the people who were with her. Lucy had vomited on Sunday night. She was lethargic and clumsy on Monday, and she collapsed on Tuesday. The timeline fits with Drew Farmer's account, which means Evelyn most likely shook Lucy earlier on Sunday, but they have to prove it. Warner mentions Lucy's rib fractures and says different hands create different fracture patterns. She demonstrates by using her own hands and Cragen's hands. Stabler and Warner go to the hospital where they measure Evelyn's hands. Warner declares her to be a match, and Stabler arrests her for assault and attempted murder. Evelyn protests, saying she'd never shake her baby. She loves her. She is a good mother.At the precinct, Evelyn will not confess and asks for her lawyer. Novak looks forward to convicting her, but Stabler says any parent will sympathize with her. Sometimes babies just won't stop crying. You cuddle them, you pick them up… hell, you'll beg them. Sometimes nothing works. Evelyn's lawyer, Rebecca Balthus, arrives. She severely chastises Novak for accusing an innocent woman. Novak has little sympathy for someone who shook the life out her child. Balthus maintains her client's innocence.In the courtroom, Evelyn's attorney challenges Warner's assertion that Shaken Baby Syndrome is the only cause of Lucy's symptoms. She asks if Warner is familiar with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or HLH. Balthus asks if it isn't true that HLH also causes bleeding of the brain and eyes. Warner acknowledges that it is true. Balthus asks if Lucy's blood was tested for HLH. There is no blood test for HLH, but Warner points out that HLH could not have caused Lucy's rib fractures. Balthus is able to make the fractures due to the CPR performed and Stabler's grab and run. Balthus returns to the possibility of HLH, and Warner states an autopsy is the only way to distinguish between HLH and Shaken Baby Syndrome. Balthus finally gets her to admit that HLH is a possibility.Evelyn takes the stand where she says the day Lucy was born was the happiest day of her life. Evelyn says that she neither spanked nor shook Lucy. She knows what shaking can do to a baby. Novak gets Evelyn to admit that Sarah was the primary caregiver and then confesses that Lucy was crying that night and Evelyn didn't know what to do to make her stop. Since she was ruining a rare romantic date, Evelyn had shaken her out of desperation. Evelyn begins to cry and says she would never hurt her baby. Novak closes for the prosecution.A triumphant Novak meets Stabler in the hall, and is positive that the jury has seen through Evelyn. Stabler is not so sure. ""I've worked enough battered kid cases to know: giving birth doesn't make you a mother, but juries… they believe what they need to believe."" His phone rings. He learns that Lucy has suffered a stroke and isn't expected to live.At the hospital, Morella tells Novak and Stabler that a massive brain hemorrhage has destroyed Lucy's cerebral cortex and she would already be dead without the life support. Stabler asks her how long she can be kept alive, and Morella says she doesn't know - days, months. Morella says Lucy's persistent vegetative state means all she feels is pain and the only thing that will end her suffering is an infection or turning off the machines. Stabler asks Novak to take Lucy's condition to the jury. She says summations are over and the judge is almost ready to charge them. Stabler says, ""This baby's suffering is not irrelevant."" Novak tells him she will see what she can do.At the court rotunda, Novak argues to the judge that Lucy's change may make a murder charge. Balthus points out that Evelyn will not pull the plug and new evidence would only be relevant if offered by the defense. The prosecution only gets one bite at the apple. The judge agrees and Novak's motion is denied.Novak pages Stabler to the courtroom and he asks about the verdict. She tells him the jury was hopelessly deadlocked and a new trial begins Monday. The jury will hear that Lucy is brain-dead, but Evelyn is so sympathetic that, although she is a murderer, Evelyn will get away with everything again as long as Lucy is technically alive.At the hospital, Stabler sees Evelyn reading a story to Lucy. Evelyn asks why he has come, and he says, ""To see Lucy."" She asks if he has any children.  When he tells her he has four, she asks what he wants from her. He says he just wants to see Lucy put out of her pain. Evelyn says she believes it is up to God. Stabler says he believes that as well, adds, ""I love my children, and if one of them was sick I would do anything in the world to make them better, but I would also pray to God that if all hope were gone that he would give me the strength just to end their suffering."" Evelyn does not back down, and tells him, ""I love my daughter. If I lose her, I might as well be dead myself."" Elliot leaves Lucy's hospital room.Stabler has asked Cragen to arrange a meeting with DA Arthur Branch. Stabler says he thinks the DA's office should fight to turn off Lucy's life support. Stabler talks about a couple cases he's read about in the paper. One case is in California where the DA was successful, and one case is in Florida where the parents prevented the machines from being shut off. Branch queries his motivation: is he concerned about Lucy or is this about finally nabbing Evelyn Prichard? Stabler tells him that he doesn't know whether Evelyn is truly a grieving mother or manipulating the situation to beat a murder rap. What he does know is Lucy is in constant pain and she will never get better. Branch agrees to the motion, but warns him that they must tread lightly or the police and DA's office will be painted as baby-killers.Novak comes to the precinct unhappy that Stabler went over her head, although she admits she has been ambivalent about how to proceed because she is not a mother. Cragen says, ""Welcome to Special Victims. It's not always black and white.""In the judge's chambers, Novak defends her motion against a bitterly derisive Balthus who claims the prosecution is using the motion in order to beef up the charge against her client to murder. The judge agrees Evelyn's right to control her daughter's fate is compromised by the charges she is facing, but Novak will still have to prove that Lucy is better off dead before the judge will grant the motion.At the hearing, Dr. Morella explains Lucy is in excruciating pain and her bones are demineralized. They have become so brittle that just yesterday one broke during a diaper change. A simple touch can cause a seizure. Balthus counters this with tales of people who have recovered from persistent vegetative states. She believes miracles are possible. During redirect, Novak focuses on how much pain Lucy is experiencing. Suddenly, Evelyn breaks down and cries, ""Enough!"" Over her lawyer's objections, she says she wants the machines turned off and for Lucy not to suffer any more. The judge asks Balthus to explain to her client that she will face murder charges if she does this. Evelyn says she doesn't care and finally confesses that she did it. She tells them that on Sunday night, she had just wanted a chance at a normal life again with the man she loved; a night to herself. Lucy had been sleeping peacefully at first, but then woke up and wouldn't stop screaming. Evelyn admits she was so angry that she shook her over and over until she stopped crying. When she put her down, Lucy had smiled up at her; and everything seemed to be all right. Even after the doctor told her that Lucy had been shaken, Evelyn kept telling herself that it couldn't be her fault. Sobbing, she says, ""I never meant to hurt her.""Cragen enters a bar where Stabler is hunched over empty shot glasses. Stabler asks if it is over, and Cragen tells him that Lucy went peacefully 10 minutes after the machines were unplugged. Evelyn has been taken to the Bedford Hills women's correctional facility. After Stabler slugs back another drink, Cragen asks for his keys and says he'll drive him home. Stabler picks up a photograph from the bar and looks at it. The image shows Maureen when she was about Lucy's age. He recalls to Cragen that he had just gotten out of the Marines, he was unemployed, and Kathy was pregnant again. Kathy went out one night, and he was home alone with Maureen. His daughter spilled grape juice on a brand new carpet they had just bought, although they couldn't afford it. He had grabbed Maureen's arm to spank her, but she twisted away and he slapped her on the face. As his arm goes up for a second blow, a voice in his head told him, ""Stop!"" He continues,  ""So I'm standing there in the middle of this room, holding the limp body of my little girl, and she starts crying. And I pick her up, and I just keep saying over and over, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.' I could've killed my kid over a lousy carpet."" Cragen walks him toward the door."

SVU is called in after the patrol officers first on the scene find the victim's torn underwear in the alley.  She'd been doused with fuel oil and an accelerant, and sexually assaulted with a metal pipe.Although most of the victim's body is burned beyond DNA testing, her feet are intact because she was wearing tall leather boots.  On her foot is a henna pattern which Warner recognizes as a Muslim design.  The lab salvages part of the label on the victim's burned purse; Olivia and Elliot determine that the label originally read ""Atlantic Avenue Brooklyn.""  Among the Middle Eastern merchants in that neighborhood they locate the henna artist who did the pattern; she identifies the victim as a Mira Elbisi.  Mira's husband and his mother publish a newspaper called The Arab-American, whose office is located nearby.Olivia and Elliot visit Mira's husband at the newspaper office.  Until prompted by Elliot he doesn't ask why they're asking questions about his wife, and then he asks if she's made a new complaint against him.  Later, Munch and Fin interview the mother at the family home.  Neither of them saw Mira the night she died, don't know where she was, and don't explain very well why they weren't particularly concerned about her.   Their accounts of their whereabouts that night don't match, either.Word of Mira's death by burning leaks to the press.  Elliot learns that three weeks ago, Mira called the 7-4 precinct and said she was afraid of her husband; when officers responded, she apologized for getting the police involved.  A week later a neighbor called the 7-4 because he heard loud arguing inside the Elbisis' home; that time, Mother Elbisi sent the responding officers away.  The neighbor tells Olivia and Elliot he suspected Mira's husband had hit her.  He also says that Mira felt stifled living with her mother-in-law, and definitely wanted more freedom.  Asked if Mira had any confidantes, the neighbor responds that she was friends with a Jewish man named Joshua Friedman, who works at ""some religious do-gooder group"".The religious group is the Interfaith Council, which works to ""build bridges"" between Muslims and Jews.  Mira had kept her work with the group a secret from her husband.  Friedman admits that he and Mira had fallen in love, and that Mira had told her husband she was leaving him for Friedman.  That gives husband and Mother Elbisi a logical motive for killing Mira, so SVU brings them both in.  While SVU is interrogating them, a report comes in of a second Muslim killed in the same way as Mira Elbisi.  Victim #2 is a man, Tariq Assad, also doused with fuel oil and an accelerant and sexually assaulted with a metal pipe Since the fuel oil aspect of Mira's killing was never publicized, clearly Assad's murder wasn't the work of a copycat.  Or the Elbisis, since they were at SVU's office at the time.Olivia and Elliot learn from Assad's brother that Tariq also had been  involved with the Interfaith Council.  They visit Joshua Friedman again, who tells them that the previous week Mira and Tariq had participated in a Council-sponsored panel discussion about Islam, an event which had been open to the public.  The Council office has heavy security, including cameras.  The video of the reception following the discussion shows one attendee who seems to pay particular attention to Elbisi and Assad.  A close-up of the attendee reveals a label on his jacket:  ""Donaghue Heating Service.""  Heating service = source of fuel oil.Donaghue's owner identifies the attendee as his employee Sean Webster, who bolts when his boss calls him over and says the police want to talk to him.  Sean is arrested, and explains that he ran because he'd had some trouble with the law before, as a kid. Police records show that Sean has a juvenile conviction for attacking a fellow student, a Pakistani.  Also, Sean's father died when Sean was 10; afterward his mother had a nervous breakdown and later moved herself and her son from Long Island to the city.During further interrogation, Sean displays an unmistakable hatred of Arabs which is clearly influenced by 9/11.  The accelerant used in the burnings was benzene, and a search of the Webster home turns up a can of cleaning fluid containing benzene.  When Sean kills a Muslim prisoner at Central Booking, Casey has to include a hate-crime charge she'd rather have left out.  Enter Oliver Gates for the defense, the attorney specializing in insanity and mental defect defenses.  He's also a fierce opponent of New York's hate-crime statute, and Sean's case provides a perfect soapbox opportunity.  Gates hires an eminent expert who's done substantial research into a genetic basis for hatred and violence.   Under her theory, Sean isn't responsible for his actions because he was born with a genetic predisposition toward hatred and violence.At trial Gates' expert makes a very impressive presentation, while George Huang's prosecution testimony winds up possibly working both ways.  When Sean takes the stand, Casey gets him to acknowledge that he hates only Arabs, not also other ethnicities such as black non-Muslims and Asians.  Casey then asks him why he hates only Arabs.   Sean begins explaining calmly enough that Arabs ""study engineering and aviation, then use it to attack us…We fought for Muslims in Bosnia…My father fought for them in Desert Storm and died for his country….""  From there Sean totally loses his cool and goes into an absolute anti-Arab tirade.  The judge stops the trial until Sean can collect himself.  Casey tells Olivia and Elliot to find out how Sean's father died; she needs to know whether Sean killed out of hate, or revenge.Later Casey calls on Gates while he's visiting Sean at Rikers, and offers a plea bargain.  When Gates refuses, Casey presents Sean's father Seth Webster, who is in fact alive and well and living in Detroit with his second wife.  When Sean sees his father, the real reason for his hatred of Arabs comes spewing out like water from a burst pipe:  Seth Webster had left his first wife and Sean for an Arab woman he met in Kuwait during Desert Storm.  Sean's mother had told her son that his father died a hero in the war, but when Sean applied for college financial aid he learned his father was alive.  Totally enraged at his father's abandonment and the hardship it caused his mother, Sean screams that if he had a gun right now he'd shoot his father, then go and set his second wife and their kids on fire.With this revelation, Gates' genetic predisposition defense goes down the drain.  Later SVU gets word that the Muslim whom Sean killed at Central Booking had friends:  Sean's just been stabbed to death in the yard at Rikers."

After Stabler responds to Jacob's call for help, he finds the boy at home shot dead, and his mother and older brother Adam gone. Adam freely confesses to the murder when Stabler and Benson finally locate them, and reveals that his mother terrifed her sons about the world around them and especially about being put into foster care, telling them that they'd be better off dead than in foster care. Marilyn is arrested for facilitating a homicide, and insists upon testifying before the Grand Jury, where she slips up and mentions DYFS (the New Jersey State Child Protective Service Agency).  Benson and Stabler cross the river and discover that under another name, Marilyn lost custody of her eldest son, named Daniel, to the foster care system there. Daniel, now an adult, tells the detectives that his mother's mental illness intensified after his father's death. Since his father was murdered during a robbery on a trip to the store to get milk for Daniel, his mother held him responsible for his father's death and began to physically abuse him so severely that he was removed from her home.When Benson and Stabler introduce the brothers, Adam is in complete disbelief and shock, because Marilyn had told him that Daniel had been raped and beaten and murdered in foster care.  Adam then confesses that Marilyn had urged him to shoot Jacob and then commit suicide so that they would not suffer the same fate as Daniel.

When the detectives find blood on a pillow at the foster home, they start to suspect the foster parents. They also find out the boy was killed by a cheese grater. They charge the father but soon learn he had called the social worker many of times asking for her to take the child away because he couldn't take care of him. The social worker never answered the calls which led the police to arrest her and charge her for depraved indifference. The social worker somehow gets off but feels so bad about what she did that she commited suicide. The detectives then learn that the foster parents had stuck one of their former foster children in a mental institution to hide her away when she saw the murder of the little boy. The detectives track down the girl and she tells them that the foster mother killed the little boy.

She escapes, and the would-be kidnapper flees with only a handful of her hair. Elliot and Olivia are called to the scene. Told that the perp was on a bicycle, Elliot wonders how he had expected to carry off Patty.Olivia talks with Patty, who describes the perp as a ""big boy"" (that is, not a man or a young boy). Patty had encountered him once before, outside the neighborhood supermarket where her parents shop.  Somebody knows Patty's movements, and seems to be specifically interested in her.The supermarket manager tells Fin and Munch that the previous week, a man and a teenage boy were in a dark blue van parked near the store, obstructing the delivery entrance. He noted the van's Arizona license plate number. A check on that number reveals that the van was also seen recently near Patty's school.Elliot and Olivia talk to the school security officer who reported the van, which had been parked in the teachers' zone. As they leave the school, they see the van parked nearby and call for backup. Shortly before dismissal, a boy emerges from the van and mingles with the parents waiting for their children. Cragen and Fin confront the van's driver, and arrest him after he unsuccessfully tries to pass himself off as a cop. Elliot, Olivia and Munch arrest the boy.The man is Peter Carson. The boy is Kenneth Pratt, who is actually 23 years old but looks younger. Both men are private investigators, licensed in New York and Arizona. Carson is known for rescuing kidnapped children and returning them to their custodial parents. Patty picks Pratt out of a line-up.Initially both Carson and Pratt refuse to discuss their ongoing investigation, which they insist is based on  accurate information. Cragen tells Pratt that New York state is ready to revoke Pratt's PI license, which will lead to Arizona's doing the same. Faced with possibly losing his livelihood, Pratt reveals that he and Carson were hired to return Patty to her real mother. Carson insists that Patty is his client's daughter, who vanished four years ago.Elliot and Olivia visit Carson's client, Manhattan resident Michele Osborne. She readily invites them into her home and shows them photos of her daughter, Anna. One is of Anna at age two, when she disappeared. The other is an age-progressed photo showing what Anna would look like today. The second photo looks startlingly like Patty Branson. Michele tells the detectives that Anna disappeared from a rest stop when Anna and Michele's husband, Steve, were driving to his parents' home in New Jersey. Steve Osborne is dead, killed in a car crash. Michele is sure that Patty is Anna, and happily shows them Anna's bedroom all ready and waiting for a six-year-old.Elliot and Olivia arrest Michele for conspiracy to commit kidnapping. The arraignment judge grants Casey's request for an order of protection forbidding Michele to come within 100 feet of Patty, her parents, their home, or Patty's school. Huang is intrigued by the fact that Michele had updated Anna's bedroom for her daughter's return. Most missing children's bedrooms are kept the way they were when the children disappeared.A background check reveals that Michele is clean. Birth records indicate that Anna and Patty were born two weeks apart in different cities, so they weren't switched at birth. However, Huang can't find Anna in the Missing Children's Center database. An FBI database reveals why: Anna is dead.SVU is informed of a disturbance at the Bransons' house. Michele has violated the order of protection, repeatedly ringing the Bransons' doorbell and saying she ""has proof."" Olivia tells Michele that they know the truth: Anna was killed in the same car crash as Steve Osborne. Michele argues that the police never found Anna's remains. Olivia replies that the car had been hit by a gasoline tanker; there had been nothing left to find. Michele vehemently insists that Anna is alive.During Olivia's exchange with Michele, Elliot finds Peter Carson in a parked car around the corner. Carson has the lab report of a DNA test on Patty's hair. The report indicates that Patty is Michele's daughter.The Bransons insist that Sarah carried and gave birth to Patty. Warner tests a lock of Anna's hair provided by Michele. Anna and Patty are different children, but their mitochondrial DNA (from the mother) is identical. Their birth records indicate that both girls were conceived through in vitro fertilization. The only explanation for the current situation is that the fertility doctor implanted Michele Osborne's embryo into Sarah Branson.Michele and Sarah had gone to the same doctor, Dr. Stanley Norton. Michele tearfully apologizes for her behavior, and Sarah asks that the order of protection be lifted. However, Casey insists on taking Michele to trial for violating the order. Given that Norton created this mess, Olivia asks Casey to cut Michele a deal. Casey tells Olivia to talk to Norton. If he verifies Michele's and the Bransons' stories, she'll consider it.Norton denies that his clinic could have made such a glaring error. The only way this incident could have occurred is if Michele had agreed to donate her unused embryos. He provides a copy of Michele's signed consent form, which contains checkboxes for multiple items. The box agreeing to donate unused embryos is marked. Michele verifies her signature, but firmly denies marking that particular box. Norton's office had specifically asked her and Steve about donating embryos, and they had declined because they didn't want someone else giving birth to their child. Michele hadn't had any extra embryos; Norton had placed all her fertilized eggs back into her.SVU obtains the original consent form, and the lab determines that the disputed mark is a forgery. Casey obtains subpoenas and warrants for all of Norton's patient records and clinic logs. Sarah Branson's records note that none of her eggs had fertilized. Instead of telling the Bransons the truth, Norton had simply given Sarah one of Michele's embryos.Patty disappears during a school trip to a local museum. Shown a picture of Michele, the teacher remembers seeing her near the museum entrance as the children left. Michele's house is empty, but family photos show that she has a beach house in Queens. Elliot and Olivia go there and arrest Michele for kidnapping. Patty is physically unharmed, but emotionally very upset: Michele told her that she's her real mommy.Michele refuses to accept a plea bargain, or to give up the fight for Patty. Casey realizes that while the law and the evidence is on the Bransons' side, the jury's feelings aren't. She seeks advice from devoted father-of-four Elliot. If Michele is convicted she'll go to prison, which she doesn't deserve. If Michele is acquitted, she'll keep fighting the Bransons for Patty in a battle that will never end. Elliot recounts the biblical story of King Solomon, who had to decide which of two women claiming the same child was really the mother. Solomon called for a sword, then ordered that the child be divided in two and half given to each woman. Casey says that unlike Solomon, she can't split the baby. Elliot replies that Solomon didn't have to.At the trial, Patty Branson takes the witness stand. She testifies that Michele told her she was Patty's ""egg mommy."" Although Sarah Branson gave birth to Patty, the egg Patty came from was from Michele. Eventually Casey asks, ""You know what Michele said about being your egg mommy is true, right?"" Patty begins to cry and wails, ""No. It's not true! Michele's not my mommy! I don't want to go with Michele! Please don't take me away!"" She asks to leave the witness stand, but Casey says she can't until they're finished. Patty becomes more and more hysterical until Michele can stand any more, and cries, ""Stop it! Just stop it!"" Michele then apologizes to Patty and says she'll never bother her again. Patty runs off the witness stand to the Bransons, crying ""Mommy! Mommy!""Michele pleads guilty to custodial interference, and is given a suspended sentence. She decides to move out of state, because it's too painful to be near Patty and not see her. Olivia finishes auditing Norton's fertility clinic records. Michele had in fact had extra embryos, ten of which had been implanted in other women. In addition to Patty, somewhere out there Michele has two other daughters and a son."

Benson is finally able to get the girl to write down her home address so she can contact her mother. Benson also asks the girl who is the father of her child. She replies that the father is Abraham, her husband. Benson goes to the address with a patrol car backup. When she knocks, the door is opened by a group of children. Benson asks if there is anyone home with them, and a man comes to the door asking if he can help her. Clearly visible is a snake tattoo on his arm. Benson asks the man if his name is Abraham. When he responds vaguely, she asks him to step outside after which he closes the door on her. A few moments later a number of shots are fired at the officers and Benson calls for backup. Fin, Munch, Stabler and the backup units arrive. Fin reports that the neighbors say there's mostly a lot of women and children living there. The only report on the address has been a noise citation. As they are talking, numerous shots are heard inside of the apartment. The entry team breaks into the apartment to discover all the children have been shot. The perp is gone from the building. The detectives enter to discover clear signs of a cult. Commandments are painted on the walls as is a huge portrait of Abraham. Candles and bibles as well as blood-stained teddy bears are strewn about the darkened home. The detectives are emotionally floored by the destruction of young lives. Benson is particularly troubled, because she had seen those same children only moments before.The group is gathered back at the station house where Cragen briefs them all. He says that signs point to a cult group. Other members may have escaped through a secret tunnel in the house. Priorities include finding these escaped members and identifying all the bodies. All of the detectives are ordered to go through a psych evaluation before they can continue on the case. Huang interviews a stoic and emotionally unattached Stabler. Munch tries to keep his cynical nature in check, but Huang breaks through to help Munch recognize that, cynical though he may be, he can still be repulsed by the nature of such a horrid crime. A tearful Benson is grieving for the children and worries that she cannot hold it together. Huang says she is handling it, by acknowledging how much it is affecting her. Fin is clearly shaken and knows he's seen too much. As the detectives are back at work in the department, Stabler shares that collected items from inside the house, such as mail and paycheck stubs, reveals a number of women's names, but the social security numbers and names are fraudulent matches. Munch is convinced one of the women at least will come forward to identify her child in the morgue. Benson returns with a positive ID on Abraham based on fingerprint dusting inside the house. His real name is Eugene Hoff and he's in the system for four instances in the 80's involving identity theft, check forgery, counterfeiting, and various frauds. Fin comes in to say he's taking himself off the case. He knows he needs time to recuperate emotionally from the devastation he's witnessed. Munch walks him out. Stabler says Abraham's last place of employment was a Pentacostal church. An agitated Benson says she believes they're going to take her off the case because she was too emotional. However, within minutes, Cragen temporarily releases Stabler from duty and refers him to psych services after Huang's evaluation. Cragen partners Benson with Munch for this investigation. Benson and Munch head to Abraham's former church. The pastor says that Eugene (Abraham) was very popular, and the more popular he became, the more radical he became. He was preaching that the serpent was Christ. Benson realizes that explains his tattoo. The pastor continues by telling the detectives that ten families left the church when Eugene was fired. He gives them the names of one of the families that left the church and later left Eugene's group. As the detectives arrive at the home, the couple tells Benson and Munch about Abraham's increasing paranoia – hoarding food and weapons, taking the members to the firing range, separating the men and the women. They also said he seemed to pay most of his attention to the girls and women, and one night they found them in the room of their daughter, trying to seduce her. They realize his maniacal ways now, but back then, they say, he was mesmerizing. They offer a tape of Abraham preaching.Back at the station house, Huang says Abraham's behavior, including sexual relations with the members, is not that unusual in cults. As they are talking, a woman calls to ask if one of the boys killed was a nine-year-old boy with brown hair and a scar on his leg. While Cragen talks to her, Huang traces the call. She refuses to give her name, but she was on long enough to have the call traced to the same hospital where Melanie is. Benson immediately goes to the hospital pressing Melanie to give her information so she can protect her mother. The girl gives up the address where the women are hiding out and hoards of weapons are found. None of the women will talk when the detectives try to interview them. Benson returns to the hospital to try to get a positive ID from Melanie while Munch heads to the morgue to get Warner's report. Warner relays the information that all of the children have the same father except the shooter. Munch is angry and calls Abraham an incestuous pedophile who kills all his victims so they can't testify against him. Warner reminds Munch that there is still one victim alive – Melanie. When Benson arrives to talk to Melanie, she is told that her father checked her out a short time ago. In the station house, a voice match is made between one of the women and the phone call asking about the young boy. Cragen tells Benson that several numbers were found in this woman's (Sarah's) pocket, but she won't reveal what they mean. Benson compares Sarah to Sarah from the bible who was married to Abraham. The biblical Sarah allowed Abraham to have sex with her daughter so that he could have another child. Benson becomes angrier as the woman continues says that Abraham protects them and she doesn't expect Benson to understand. Benson counters that she is just as responsible for the deaths of the children and the rape of her daughter because she sat back and did nothing. Back in the SVU room, Munch comes in with news that forensic accounting came up with the meaning of the numbers – all ten digit numbers with the first four digits the same – bank accounts. They had all been closed out the day before to the tune of $600,000. Most of the money came from fraudulent checks from large corporations because they take longer to realize the fraud. Cragen asks if it was coincidence that Abraham does all his bogus banking in one place. Benson realizes that he must have had an inside guy. Benson and Munch find out the processor and go to the bank to confront him. When he (Reg) realizes how much trouble he's in, he offers information that there is one more account with more money than all the others together. A plan is devised whereas Reg will slip a GPS tracker in with the money when Abraham comes in to cash it out. The detectives and Cragen devise a plan to stake out the bank and arrest Abraham when he tries to cash out. Abraham becomes suspicious at the way Reg is acting. He turns to leave and Cragen and Munch draw their weapons. Benson hears the commotion on her radio and leaves her post in the outside squad car to come in and assist. As Abraham draws a knife to his throat, Benson runs and tackles him from behind and he is cuffed and arrested.In the interrogation room, Abraham gives up nothing of value to Benson. When she exits, Cragen tells her (and Novak) that it's okay. As soon as DNA results are back, they'll charge him with statutory rape. Just then, Abraham's lawyer arrives and overhears the conversation. He says that Abraham had no reason to suspect the girl was his daughter and no court will allow an estimation of age on the deceased victims, so there is really no proof that Abraham did anything wrong. He enters the interrogation room to talk with his client. Back in the hallway, Novak says he's right. They can hold Abraham for 24 hours on check fraud, but unless they can produce Melanie to testify against him, they don't really have a case. Munch walks up to the group with information that the bank account that Abraham had tried to close that day had over a million dollars. It had come from a trust fund of John Kramer from Englewood, New Jersey. This time the name and social are real, but Kramer was reported missing ten years ago along with his wife and daughter. The daughter was about two at the time. Her name was Melanie. Kramer's parents had reported them missing, but they are now deceased. They decide to talk to the former investigating officer.The officer remembers the case and produces a photo of the Kramers from the file. The wife's real name was Cindy. He doesn't recognize the photo of Abraham, but does say he always thought it was some kind of cult involvement. His parents had noted that Kramer had become really secretive and donated his trust fund to the religious group. The only contact the parents had after their son left was a letter from the group demanding the money from their granddaughter's trust fund worth about two million. It can only be accessed when the girl turns 21 or has a baby – whichever comes first. Benson realizes that's Abraham's motive for keeping Melanie alive – at least until she delivers. The officer tells them that Kramer's last known activity was charging a lot of building supplies on his credit cards. Munch remembers that the neighbors had said something about middle of the night construction. Benson counters with the fact that they searched that place top to bottom. Munch says, ""We didn't check the walls.""Back at the cult complex, an x-ray of a wall reveals John Kramer's body inside. Positive ID is made from the credit cards in the wallet still in his jacket pocket. Benson confronts Sarah again with the wallet, the photos of John, and the wedding ring he was wearing when he died. Sarah breaks and gives out the location of a warehouse Abraham owns up north where he and Melanie are hiding out. Benson and a group of officers go to the scene and find Melanie on bed in an office area of the warehouse. Abraham enters with groceries and as the officer tries to arrest and cuff Abraham, Melanie pulls out a gun and shoots him in the leg. Benson convinces Melanie to let the officer go get some medical help. Both Abraham and Benson try to convince Melanie they are telling the truth while Melanie keeps her gun pointed on Benson and Benson keeps her gun on Abraham. Finally, Abraham is screaming at Melanie that they had to send so many people to arrest him because he is greater than man and greater than God. Melanie shoots him and breaks down. Benson grabs the gun and hugs the crying child. Melanie says that he was a liar. He said he was greater than God, but no one is."

The first two, a wheel-chair bound woman and a woman with a baby, were raped. Both of these women, Coleen and Samantha, lived in the same building. The third woman, Gina, was attacked about a block away, but was able to fight off her attacker with the crutches she was using since her knee surgery. All three say the perp tried to stay behind them and that he smelled of cigarettes. Gina was able to give a bit more description – white male, medium height, sunglasses, and a hooded sweatshirt. The sketch looked amazingly like the ""Unabomber"". Stabler makes the connection that the perpetrator seems to attack women with a weakness – a woman in a wheelchair, a woman with a baby, and a woman on crutches. As the detectives follow up on possible witnesses, Fin gets a possible hit with a man seen leaving the scene of the last crime and getting into a blue, Ford Taurus. Stabler and Benson retrace Colleen's path the previous day, and at the nail salon, find out that a man came in with a hooded sweatshirt and glasses. He smelled like an ashtray and his nails were filthy.While the detectives are discussing the case at the station, Benson suggests they get Huang to start working up a psychological profile, but Fin mentions that he can't because he's in Washington. Next, a woman enters the station house babbling nonsensically and carrying a copy of the sketch on which she has made strange notations. When Benson asks her if she was attacked, she does manage to tell her that is why she is there. As the detectives reach out to lead her to an area, she becomes physically violent, at one point punching Fin in the jaw. The detectives quickly realize the woman is suffering from some kind of mental illness and go with her to Bellevue Psych for an examination. At Bellevue, Benson sees Dr. Rebecca Hendrix, a cop turned psychiatrist, who informs the detectives that the woman is Miranda Cole who suffers from schizophrenia. Miranda does mention again that she was attacked. However, she also keeps saying she was being stalked by terrorists who tried to place listening devices inside of her. A rape examination proves too difficult to do while Miranda is so frantic, much to Benson's dismay. Hendrix won't budge as she realizes that Miranda is doubly troubled by her schizophrenia and post traumatic stress disorder. Hendrix believes that Miranda is telling the truth about being attacked and adds that schizophrenics rarely false report sexual assaults. Again, it appears that the perp has attacked another ""weak"" woman.When the next victim is attacked, the evidence reveals the same M.O. and the attack occurs in the same neighborhood as the previous ones. This victim, Laurie, was killed in the process, and the detectives realize the perpetrator's behavior is escalating and becoming more violent. The detectives realize their best possible witness is Miranda Cole in the psych ward, and they go back to convince Hendrix to get the examination done. Benson reveals a certain animosity against Hendrix saying that she became a psychiatrist because she thought she was too good to be a cop. When the detectives arrive at the hospital, Hendrix has the rape kit waiting on them. Stabler likes Hendrix because he thinks they've finally found a doctor who ""gets it"". When Hendrix agrees to sit in and help in the interview with Miranda (temporarily lucid due to medications), Stabler readily agrees. Hendrix warns them that schizophrenics suffering from post-traumatic stress often relive the experience as they talk, and the sounds, details, and sensations come back to them not in flashbacks, but in very real episodes. After the three enter, Miranda tells them bits of her story – enough to convince the detectives of the similarities between Miranda's attack and the other attacks. When Benson shows her the sketch, Miranda again withdraws into her illness. The rape kit reveals that Miranda did indeed have a recent sexual encounter, and DNA evidence is available this time. DNA profiles tag another psych patient, Raymond, as the man with whom Miranda had sex with. Hendrix says he's not a rapist. His DNA is only in the system because he's continually filing false reports against his neighbor for trying to kill his cat. Hendrix explains that it is possible that Ray Ray and Miranda had sex, but that he is not the rapist they are looking for. Miranda could have encountered the real perp at some time before. The detectives and Dr. Hendrix return to Bellevue to again question Miranda. They're told by the nurse that she checked herself out. The ward is only required to keep a patient for 24 hours if they're lucid and taking their meds, so Miranda was able to sign herself out.The team decides their most pressing need is to track down Miranda. Hendrix mentions she has a sister, and the detectives and doctor go to see her. Her sister is distraught when she learns her schizophrenic sister was telling the truth about a man hurting her and trying to kill her. The sister tells them of an apartment her Mom left them. It so happens that the apartment is located very near the other crime scenes. When the detectives go to the apartment, they find a hysterical Miranda, now clearly off her meds. She begins reliving the experience. She mentions the kitchen, and the detectives go and see that Miranda has preserved the crime scene with her pants and underwear still on the floor. She describes the man exactly as the sketch. A blood smear is found on the cabinets. Then Miranda repeats the words of her attacker revealing his name is Thomas. The detectives run a list of all blue, Ford Tauruses in the area, and then narrow it down to owners named Thomas. There is a single hit – Thomas Mathers. Fin also notes that the blood in Miranda's apartment matched the blood on Gina's crutch.Stabler, Fin, and Warner go to Mathers' apartment to question him and convince him to offer a DNA swab. They are surprised to find out their suspect is homosexual. They question Mathers' whereabouts of three nights ago. The roommate says he was home in bed. Finally, Mathers agrees to a mouth swab for DNA. When they arrive back at the station, Benson reveals new information discovered on Mathers. A series of peeping incidents that took place at Mathers' college when he was a student mysteriously stopped during Mathers' three leaves of absence and after he graduated. After graduation, Mathers moved to Cleveland where the PD reported a string of unsolved breaking and entering complaints – all women – nothing was taken. Stabler said Mathers had an alibi – his boyfriend had said he was home in bed all night. Benson says either the boyfriend is a liar or a heavy sleeper. Mathers' cell phone records reveal that, on the night of the attacks, Thomas' cell phone received a call from his mother in Queens at 10pm. Then at midnight, there was an outgoing call to his mom, but the signal was transmitted by a tower in Queens. He would have had plenty of time to get back before the attack on Colleen at 2am.Munch and Fin head to Thomas' mother's house on a little-information seeking hunt. When they arrive, one of the first things they notice is the heavy cigarette smoke that permeates the air due to Mrs. Mathers' chain smoking. Under the pretense of asking about a hit-and-run accident, Mrs. Mathers' volunteers that Thomas was indeed there after midnight trying to help fix the furnace, and arguing that he couldn't stay. After about 20 minutes, Thomas left saying he had things to do, so the furnace didn't get fixed. Munch tells her he'll be happy to give the furnace a check. Thomas arrives and wants to know what's going on. After a brief period, Munch comes back upstairs to reveal the furnace is shot. He tells Fin to look at how filthy his nails are; Fin tells him he's going to need a manicure and turns to Thomas to ask if he knows where he can get one. Detectives Fin and Munch tell him he's under arrest and take him into custody.To Benson's dismay, Stabler asks Hendrix to sit in on the interrogation. Stabler also wants to know why a homosexual man would rape. Hendrix replies that it's probably for the same reason a heterosexual man does. It's all about the position of power. Thomas enters the room, and denies that he raped anyone. In response to the detectives questioning, he says his roommate passed out from drinking and didn't know he left. He also vehemently denies that he is gay and even acts disgusted by the notion. He tells them he's just going through a ""thing"". The detectives notice a cut on his throat is bleeding. Thomas claims it came from shaving. As the detectives meet outside to debrief on the interrogation, Cragen comes in to say that he's the wrong guy; the DNA didn't match the blood evidence. Hendrix and Stabler still think they've got the right guy. Everything fits – the car, the cigarette smoke, the dirty fingernails, and Hendrix's profile. Benson is livid that Stabler is siding with the shrink when the DNA cleared Thomas. Hendrix knows when she is in the way, and leaves the room. After the showdown between Benson and Stabler, Hendrix pulls Stabler aside and says that she is bothered by the fact that Mathers says he cut himself shaving, but the stubble he had made him look as if he hadn't shaved in days. ""Why didn't the blood clot?"" she wonders. They go to the lab and find out the blood sample reveals a low platelet count which could keep it from clotting properly. Hendrix tells Stabler of the time during her internship when she needed some information on a patient who was unconcious and all she had to go by was his college ring. Hendrix called up the school and was able to get his medical records and save his life. She says she can't do it now because she would lose her license. Stabler smiles and says, ""But Dr. Elliot can.""Benson, meanwhile, goes back to talk to Miranda once again. Through questioning, Benson realizes that Miranda first saw her attacker in the library. She asks Miranda, who still believes it was a terrorist stalking her, to take her there and show her exactly where she was when she saw him following her. Miranda leads her to a stack of books and warns Benson that they are recording her, too. Benson turns and sees the security camera and gets the tape of Thomas confronting Miranda in the library, and this time he wasn't wearing his disguise. Benson asks Miranda to promise to take her medication, and that it will make the terrorists go away.Benson gets back to the station with the tape and Stabler and Hendrix are waiting on her. They tell her that they find out the problem was with Mathers' blood. Thomas had leukemia and in college received a marrow transplant. From that point on, Thomas's blood produced a different DNA from the rest of his body. That's why the samples didn't match. They only had taken a cheek swab rather than a blood sample for the match. They know the method they used to collect the information is not enough to get a warrant to retest Mathers' blood, but Benson offers the tape and says, ""This is.""In the courtroom, Mathers' bond is denied and he is held in custody. Hendrix enters the courtroom to tell Benson that Miranda killed herself that morning. A teary-eyed Benson asks if this is some kind of ""I told you so"". Hendrix said it had nothing to do with her, but the disease and the voices in her head. She tells Benson, ""You can't save everyone. I'm sorry."""

She was raped, beaten and repeatedly stabbed; and her throat was cut. The medical examiner estimates she died at least 48 hours before, which is consistent with her being last seen alive on Friday night.  Elena owns Brevet Investments with her husband, Jason. He had flown to Miami on Friday night for business, and was due back Sunday. When Elliot and Olivia go to the Brevet house, they find Jason bound to a living room armchair, dead about 12 hours from a slashed throat.A monogrammed keyring on the table indicates Jason's killer took Elena's keys to get into the house. Upstairs is an empty built-in safe. It's a totally pick-proof model, meaning the killer got the combination by torturing it out of Jason. A new tool called a gas chromatograph indicates the safe had contained at least $1 million in cash.The Brevets had been heavily in debt, and their company turns out to be just a high-end pyramid scheme. Their real business was laundering Colombian drug money, particularly for a bogus client called Casa Vega Enterprises. The Brevets skimmed the cash in the safe, and the dealer found out and killed them.SVU consults Narcotics detective Miguel Sandoval, who recognizes the laundering scheme. A Colombian drug dealer in Bogota is in the money in New York, but he can't move all that cash out of the US without attracting attention. So dealer hires black market money broker, who finds Colombian nationals with checking accounts in the US. These good people write clean checks in exchange for the drug cash, keeping a bit for their trouble. The dealer can deposit these checks anywhere, such as into the Casa Vega account at Brevet Investments. Then the money can be legitimately wired to Colombia.One of the Casa Vega check writers is a woman whose son Miguel sent to prison for selling marijuana out of the family business. Miguel, Elliot and Olivia pay her a visit and offer to transfer her son to a facility closer to home, if she helps them. She points them to a man named Felix Montoya.At Montoya's apartment the detectives find Felix and his wife dead in the living room, shot execution-style only a short time before. In a bedroom is their young son Antonio, who's also been shot through a pillow covering his face. However, the shooter missed and only grazed the boy's skull. In the hospital, Antonio says a ghost shot him and his parents. Outraged that any drug dealer would shoot a child in the head, Miguel insists on participating in the investigation.Ballistics tests reveal something unexpected: the weapon used to shoot the Montoyas was also used to shoot former SVU prosecutor Alexandra Cabot two years ago. A Colombian drug dealer targeted Alex when she persisted in prosecuting one of his men for raping and murdering an undercover NYPD officer. (Season 5's ""Loss"". Officially Alex is dead, but only Elliot and Olivia know she's actually alive and hiding in witness protection.)The DEA runs the entire cast of Casa Vega characters through its HIDTA computer, which searches for links between cases. However, no one connects back to the drug cartel. When Miguel then comments ""This guy really is a ghost"",  the HIDTA technician recognizes their killer as El Fantasma (""the ghost"" in Spanish), aka Liam Connors. Connors is a former IRA hit man who became unemployed after the cease-fire in Northern Ireland. Now he and others like him are in Colombia working for the cartels.Through a parking ticket on a rental car, Connors is eventually tracked down and arrested. The grand jury indicts Connors for the Brevet and Montoya murders, but not within the legal deadline for either indicting him, or releasing him until his trial. To keep Connors in custody, Casey orders Elliot and Olivia to arrest him for Alex Cabot's murder. The detectives hadn't expected that, and now they're in a major jam. Since Alex is alive, they've just charged Connors with a crime he didn't commit.Captain Cragen gets a visit from Jack Hammond, the DEA agent in charge of the undercover drug operation from two years ago. Hammond raises holy hell over Connors' arrest for Alex's murder, then realizes Cragen didn't know Alex is alive. Cragen is furious with Elliot and Olivia, who've now jeopardized everything they've worked for and every case they've worked on. Casey isn't happy either, because she's on the hot seat with the judge for charging Connors with a crime he didn't commit.Cragen and Hammond visit Alex at her home in Wisconsin, and show her a picture of Liam Connors. The person she's lived in fear of for two years, finally has a face and a name. Hammond apologizes that they can't prosecute Connors for Alex's shooting, but at least they've got him for the other four murders and the attempt on Antonio Montoya. But Alex wants Connors to pay for what he did to her, too. And the other cases depend entirely on young Antonio's testimony. As a prosecutor, Alex encouraged countless victims to stand up and face their attackers. Now it's her turn to do the same.Alex returns to New York to testify, even though it means revealing she's alive and becoming a target again. With Alex's presence, Casey manages to keep Connors in custody, and to save Elliot and Olivia's professional necks. At the trial, on cross-examination Connors' attorney asks Alex only one question:  Did you see Liam Connors shoot you? The answer is no, but Alex is able to goad Connors into blurting out in court, ""You think you're safe? They know where you are! You should have stayed dead!""The jury convicts Connors on all counts of murder and attempted murder. Cragen, the detectives and Casey gather in Casey's office for a victory party. When they hear someone else coming, they think it's Alex and quiet down to surprise her. The door opens and Hammond comes in, alone. He apologetically tells them that Alex and Antonio Montoya are being moved to new identities, and she had asked him to say goodbye for her."

The mother calls the police, and claims rape. Carrie, who is fifteen, and Justin are brought into custody for questioning. When at SVU, Carrie repeatedly claims that she and Justin did not have sex, and that she was definitely not raped. Denise states repeatedly that Carrie had been raped, and that she needed to get a rape kit. Finally, Denise convinces Benson to take Carrie to get a rape kit. However,  Benson calls a lawyer (Simone Bryce)  on the way. When Denise finds out from Bryce that her daughter can't be forced to take a rape kit, she becomes violent and loud, dragging Carrie home.The next day, Denise is found dead in her apartment, and Carrie and Justin are missing. After SVU questions the doorman of Carrie's apartment, they find that Justin left dragging a screaming girl out of the door,covered in blood. They begin searching for the two lovers. The trail leads them to a cabin in upstate New York, where Justin and Carrie are hiding. Justin is arrested for the murder of Carrie's mother.Neither lover is talking, and during interrogation, they begin yelling through the walls at each other, saying ""I love you"" to each other. When it's clear to the detectives that no answers will be uncovered by interrogation, they decide on new tactics. They first check with Carrie's school, and find that Carrie went to but left early saying she felt sick. When checking with Justin's work, they find that Carrie and Justin had a conversation on webcam, showing Carrie covered in blood, frantic, and begging Justin to take off work and come to her apartment. She said that there had been an accident. The tape is shown to Justin, but he refuses to betray Carrie.  Benson tries to break apart the lovers by telling Carrie that Justin had betrayed her and offered information, to save himself from life in prison. At first Carrie refuses to believe it, but after prodding from Benson, she begins to cry, and starts to speak. Despite Simone Bryce's advice to stop talking, Carrie starts blurting out that she hadn't meant to kill her mother, that she just lost control.Benson walks Carrie out of the interrogation rooms, right by Justin. Carrie asks him why he broke their promise by talking. He looks confused, and says that the police had their conversation on webcam, but that he hadn't told. Carrie then lunges at Benson,  screaming, ""YOU LYING BITCH,"" over and over.Benson asks Huang if  Carrie has a mental illness that might mitigate her sentence. After interviewing Carrie, Huang diagnoses her with  Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, PMDD. He says that Carrie was on her period, and that she didn't remember any of her attack on her mother (two common symptoms of PMDD). Still, Benson is convinced there is something else to the story; she found Denise suspicious from the beginning. Upon arriving at Carrie's apartment, Benson begins looking through the cabinets and refrigerator. She finds many bottles of vodka and rum. When Elliot arrives, Benson says, ""She didn't care about her daughter, she was only concerned about where her next drink was coming from!"" (Benson's mother was also an alchoholic.)  Stabler also makes a stunning discovery. He finds birth control pills, showing that Carrie was on the eighth day of her period, not her sixth. This rules out Huang's diagnosis. When Benson confronts Carrie with this information, she tells her she wants to help. Carrie looks at Bryce, and decides that she has nothing to lose by telling Benson her story. ""When I came home from school, my mom was there. She was really stressed about Justin, and she was drunk off vodka. She told me that she hated me and Justin, and that she would do anything to break us apart. She also said that she would make Justin lose his job, so he wouldn't love me anymore."" Carrie starts to cry.   The argument escalated, and Denise slapped Carrie repeatedly. Carrie then got so angry at her mother, that she hit her with a lamp- ""over, and over, and over."" Benson listened to the confession, then got up silently to leave. At court the next day, Carrie was given a shortened sentence, to be served in juvenile detention. Benson and Novak went for a drink.  ""She [Denise] was just like my mother, a drunk. She didn't care about her daughter,"" Benson said.""Olivia, you didn't kill your mother."" ""No... but I know what it's like to want to.""""When I was a senior in high school, I started dating one of my mom's college students. She found out, and when I got home from school that day, she confronted me about it. She was very drunk, and I was young and immature. She made me so mad that I told her I was moving out with him. She told me that she would fail my boyfriend...."" Casey asked why Carrie (or by implication, Benson)didn't just tell someone. ""Because then the abuse becomes real. If you keep quiet, you can pretend it's not..."" As we close, Benson has tears in her eyes."

Pamela has been a good friend of his since second grade.Stabler and Fin respond to the call. Luke becomes angered during an initial interview, and punches Fin.It turns out that Luke's father is Stabler's former partner Pete Breslin, and Stabler hasn't seen Pete in years. Later, at the station, Luke actually can't remember anything about what happened.When it comes to what Luke did to Pamela, she says Luke has never done anything like that before. Stabler talks to Pete, who mentions that his wife Lily left him and Luke, and moved to Michigan six years ago. Stabler has arranged for Luke to talk to Dr. Huang.Stabler finds Benson, Cragen, and Novak discussing the case. An angry Benson wants to put Luke away, and Novak says that with the evidence they have, which includes some of Pamela's blood on the shirt of Luke's baseball uniform, they have enough to go after Luke.Stabler tells Novak, Benson, and Cragen that that's a lot of work for a misdemeanor. Novak says she'll put it in motion, and Cragen tells Stabler to immediately get Luke into the system. Huang arrives to talk to Luke, and Pete and Stabler talk. Stabler tells Pete that Cragen said to get Luke into the system.Pete says Luke has colleges and major league baseball scouts looking at him. Stabler says Luke probably wouldn't do any time. Pete says that if Luke gets convicted, he'll have to report it to every college and major league team that looks at him, which means they won't want him, and Luke's life would be over before it gets a chance to start.Stabler advises Pete to call a lawyer, leaving Pete angry. Cragen confronts Stabler, who had told Pamela's parents that she was better off not making a complaint. For that, Cragen angrily sends Stabler home.Huang learns that Luke has been juggling baseball and a 3.8 GPA. After talking to Luke, Huang thinks he might be bipolar. Huang says that if Luke is bipolar, he needs to be on medication.Cragen says that Novak, who might be facing a psychiatric-based defense, needs to know if Luke has a history of blowing his stack. Benson talks to Pamela, who says that she's never seen Luke get angry before, even at times when he should get angry.Pamela says that nothing Luke does is ever good enough for Pete. For example, when Luke gets an A on a test, Pete says it should've been an A+. First game of the season, Luke pitches a two-hitter, and Pete says it should've been a no-hitter. And after Luke had an operation, the doctor said that if Luke didn't stop playing all year round, he'd never pitch again. Pete blamed Luke, and told Luke that it wouldn't have happened if Luke had worked out more, and then he gave Luke money to join a gym.Fin talks to Buster Flynn, who runs the gym, and Buster says that Luke worked out ""like a fiend"" until last week. Buster says Luke got into it with one of the gym members, because he thought the guy was being too slow on the bench press. Luke slugged the guy. Luke tried to slug the guy again, but Buster jumped in and broke it up, and Buster hasn't seen Luke since.Fin and Buster check Luke's locker at the gym, and they find steroids. That's what's been making Luke do things he wouldn't normally do, and that's what's been helping him balance baseball and his GPA. Buster agrees to allow an undercover cop to be put in his gym to see if anyone there is selling the steroids.Later, Cragen tells Fin and Benson that he put in an undercover request to narcotics, and he was told that Narcotics doesn't see steroids as a priority. Huang agrees that Luke must have been in a roid rage when he attacked Pamela. Benson realizes that Luke is trying so hard to satisfy Pete, and Luke thinks steroids will help him do that.That night, Benson goes to Stabler's house and apologizes to him for her attitude. Benson tells Stabler about the steroids, how Luke's been doing them for six months. Stabler wants to tell Pete about the steroids, but Benson thinks that'll make the situation worse. She says Luke begged them not to tell Pete. Benson says Luke's arraignment is first thing in the morning, and then Benson leaves.On the next morning, in the court room, Pete learns about the steroids. Luke is released into Pete's custody to await trial, and Novak has no objection to the release.Pete angrily takes Luke out of the room. Stabler follows, and finds Pete in a restroom, hitting Luke, and saying what a failure Luke is, telling Luke that it looks like he can't be a man without using steroids. Stabler tries to get Pete off of Luke, but Pete slugs Stabler. Stabler throws Pete off of Luke, and, in a rage, Stabler punches Pete several times.Stabler goes to Dr. Rebecca Hendrix's house for help, feeling that he had nowhere else to go for help, as his wife Kathy left him and took the kids with her last year. Stabler tells Hendrix what happened in the restroom. Stabler also explains that when Kathy left, she said she was tired of him being angry all the time.Hendrix asks him how long he's been at SVU, and he says 12 years. Hendrix mentions that the average stay at the SVU is two years. It turns out that the rage Stabler felt when he beat Pete up stems from how Stabler's own father treated him when he was a kid. Pete has similarities to Stabler's father.On the next day, Stabler goes to Pete's house, and finds a bullet hole in a front window. Drawing his gun, he goes inside and finds Pete bleeding from his head. Stabler rides in an ambulance with Pete. Pete admits that Luke's always been a great kid -- and then Pete goes into cardiac arrest for a couple of seconds before coming out of it. Pete's pulse is 180.Later, at the hospital, Stabler is told that the bullet lodged in Pete's skull, and didn't hit his brain. But Pete had a reaction to the epinephrine that the medics gave him in the ambulance, and it has affected his heart. The doctor believes Pete had steroids in his system.Cragen arrives, and he's not angry at Stabler anymore. Stabler tells him what the doctor said about Pete being on steroids. Cragen says that since Munch and Fin are at Pete's house, he'll have them look for the steroids. Later, Stabler visits Pete, and asks him how long he's been doing steroids.Pete says ""You remember that highway cop last year on Staten Island? Perp took his gun and shot him."" Stabler says ""Kenny Teachen. Sure."" Pete says ""He was my next partner after you. 43 years old. He got soft and got himself killed. I wasn't gonna let that happen to me.""With realization, Stabler says ""Taking the 'roids to keep your edge on the street."" Pete says ""You gonna tell my C.O.?"" Stabler says ""Pete, crime scene found your stash. There's no way to keep that quiet.""Pete says ""It was bound to happen anyway after our fight. I knew I was gonna get fired, lose my pension. That's why I tried to end it."" Stabler, suspecting something, says ""Pete, don't lie to me."" Pete says ""I'm not lying."" Stabler asks ""Where are the powder burns on the side of your head?"" If Pete had shot himself, there would be powder burns. Stabler asks ""Where's Luke?"" Pete says ""He's my son.""Benson opens the door and gets Stabler's attention. Outside the room, Benson says ""Luke's fingerprint is on the trigger of Breslin's .38."" Stabler asks if Luke's been picked up, and Benson says Cragen wanted her to get Stabler first, because Luke may be armed -- Pete's duty weapon is missing. And Luke and Pamela were both absent from school.They go to Pamela's house, where cops who are already there say they got a call about someone in the house with a gun. Benson and Stabler open the front door, guns drawn. They go to an upstairs hallway, and see Pamela in her bedroom, sitting on her bed. She signals that Luke is in there, with the missing gun.Stabler tells Luke that he's going to come in without his weapon. Stabler hands his gun to another cop, and slowly goes in. Luke is pointing the gun at his own chest, and Pamela tells him not to do it. Benson gets Pamela out of the room.Luke, in tears, explains that after what happened in the restroom, his aunt took him to her house, but Luke wanted to talk to Pete, so Luke went home. Luke walked in, and Pete laid into him about the steroids again. Luke told Pete that he can't make Luke stop taking them if Pete's taking them himself. Luke admits to Stabler that he had taken the steroids from Pete's bedroom. Luke explains that he admitted that to Pete, and Pete told him to get out.Luke admits that he was so angry that he grabbed Pete's old .38 revolver, went back to the living room, and said ""Dad, look at me. Look at me."" But Pete wouldn't look at Luke. The next thing Luke knows, Pete's on the floor, bleeding. Luke says ""He was right."" Stabler asks ""About what?"" Luke says ""I'm a failure.""Stabler, walking toward Luke, says ""Listen to me. You're not a failure."" Luke says ""I am."" Kneeling down by Luke, Stabler says ""I know you're scared and you may think this is the only way out of it, but it's not. Luke, it's the steroids. When was the last time you took them?"" Luke says ""I took them over a week ago.""Stabler says ""You're going through withdrawal. This is why you're so depressed."" Luke says ""I murdered my father."" Stabler says ""He's alive. Luke, he's alive."" Luke says ""Please don't lie to me. I shot him in the head."" Stabler says ""No, it grazed him. He's gonna be okay."" Luke says ""There was blood all over the floor.""Stabler says ""Listen to me. I just talked to him an hour ago. He wanted me to tell you that he's sorry. He said all of this is his fault. You're the only good thing in his life."" Luke says ""No. He wouldn't say that.""Stabler says ""You'll have to take my word for it. Let him tell you himself."" Luke says ""I can see him?"" Stabler says ""He wants to see you.""Luke gives up the gun. Stabler takes Luke to visit Pete at the hospital. Pete takes Luke into his arms, and says ""I'm sorry."""

Two of the victims are Jewish and the third is African-American, which suggests the incident is a hate crime. The African American victim, Jeffrey Whitlock, later dies at the hospital.Benson meets Jeffrey's parents, Mark and Jana Whitlock. The couple, who is white, had adopted Jeffrey a year earlier. Mark is a corrections officer at Rikers, which raises the possibility that Jeffrey's murder was inmate revenge. Mark tells Benson, although he has received his share of inmate abuse and threats, every guard there does.The shooter had taken his ammunition with him, but his precision sniper rifle was left behind to avoid being caught with it in his possession. The serial number is intact, which leads to a gun shop owned by Brian Ackerman. At the shop, Stabler and Munch find Brian's teenage son, Kyle, cleaning up after closing for the day. At their insistence, Kyle allows them to go inside. Wondering why Kyle is there alone, the detectives see a light in the basement and go downstairs. There they find white supremacist propaganda everywhere and a woman named Star Morrison. She insults Munch when she realizes he is Jewish. After she slaps him, they arrest her for assaulting a police officer. They also take Kyle to the station because they can't leave an underage youth alone. Morrison tells Stabler she just helps out in the shop after hours. She mentions Brian Ackerman also has a mail-order business. He leads a white supremacist group, Revolution Aryan Warriors, or RAW for short. Thoroughly indoctrinated by his father, Kyle proves to be as racist as Morrison.DNA in sweat found on the sniper rifle's scope leads to a convicted felon, Brannon Lee Redding. SVU arrests him at his apartment, which is a shrine to white supremacy. He says the rifle had been stolen from him.SVU learns Redding had been released from Rikers recently and had bought the rifle from Brian Ackerman's shop four days before the school shooting. Although the two men share racist ideologies, Brian had never visited Rikers. Mark Whitlock also denies knowing Redding and vice versa.Redding tells Novak he has no connection to RAW. She pressures him by telling him getting to trial for Jeffrey Whitlock's murder will take a year, he will be held in Rikers until the trial begins, which is plenty of time for someone to try to kill him. Even inmates have standards, one of which is zero tolerance for child murderers. Redding capitulates, and Novak and his attorney reach a plea bargain.At his trial, Redding asks to change his initial not-guilty plea to guilty; however, the judge refuses to accept the plea bargain. Redding explodes in racist fury as he is removed from the courtroom. From the courtroom's spectator section, Star Morrison picks up where Redding left off and she is arrested for contempt of court. Redding tries to strike another deal with Novak. He admits his ties to RAW, and tells her Brian Ackerman had given the rifle to him and had him shoot Jeffrey Whitlock. Star Morrison came into the gun shop just as Redding was leaving, and he had assumed she was Brian's girlfriend.Stabler tells Morrison that Redding said she had been present when Brian Ackerman gave him the rifle. The two men knew each other well enough that Redding revealed he had just been released from Rikers. Brian told Redding that RAW tracks race traitors, and a white Rikers guard named Mark Whitlock had adopted an African-American boy. Brian also provided Redding with the boy's picture.Brian Ackerman will be charged with conspiracy to commit second-degree murder, and Star Morrison will be called to testify at his trial. She tells Stabler she will not testify. Subpoenaed by Novak, Morrison appears at Brian Ackerman's trial and takes the witness stand. When she is asked to state her name, she asserts her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. She won't budge, and the judge finally lets her step down without testifying. Redding takes the stand next. Midway through his  testimony the cry ""race traitor!"" rings out, and a bullet catches Redding in the chest. Kyle Ackerman, in the courtroom's spectator section, suddenly has a gun. He continues to fire, and is joined by an armed fellow RAW member disguised as a court employee. In the shootout that follows, several people are hit, including Munch and Stabler. Kyle is moving in on Stabler for the kill when he himself is brought down by Morrison, who has reached for a dropped gun. As additional court officers rush in with their weapons drawn, Morrison quickly identifies herself as a federal agent.""Star Morrison"" is actually FBI agent Dana Lewis. The Feds have their own interest in RAW, to which end Lewis had infiltrated the group five months earlier. The reason she could not testify at Brian Ackerman's trial is now apparent. To maintain her cover she would have had to lie on the witness stand, starting with her name.An FBI sting on a skinhead terrorist group linked to RAW is successful. The federal raid reveals some interesting information that Lewis delivers to Benson. The two officers visit Mark and Jana Whitlock at home, and ask them about two life insurance policies totaling $750,000 that the couple had taken out on Jeffrey.  The average value of a policy on a child is only $50,000. The Whitlocks had paid the $350 monthly premium despite having filed for bankruptcy only two years before. They had filed the insurance claim only five days after Jeffrey's death. In the raid on the skinhead group, the FBI found documents that mentioned Mark Whitlock by name. He had pledged one-third of a $750,000 future insurance payout to RAW. Mark, not Brian Ackerman, had provided Jeffrey's picture to Redding. The Whitlocks had adopted Jeffrey for the purpose of killing him for the insurance money. After the true motive is exposed, Jana Whitlock makes one last feeble attempt to defend herself and her husband by saying,  ""We're not racists. We just needed the money."""

During the investigation, he becomes close to Olivia. They eventually find out who killed Nathan's mother, a man named Ted Carthage who runs a charity and also has paid women and girls to have sex with him. They bring Carthage in for a line-up, but Nathan can't identify him. Later, he's having lunch with Olivia at a restaurant across the street and he sees Carthage. He realizes that he's the man who killed his mother and runs across the busy street screaming at him. Olivia reaches him before he can do any harm, but later Nathan goes to the place where he works and kills him.In court, Nathan's lawyer uses as a defense a study that shows that people who see gun violence are more than twice as likely to commit violence themselves. When she cross-examines Olivia, Olivia agrees that although seeing gun violence might not justify committing murder, it might explain it. Casey decides to agree to a plea bargain. They are in court about to agree to the plea bargain when a lawyer paid for by the National Gun Association serves them with a restraining order and ordering Casey, Nathan's attorney, and Judge Donnelly to be defendents in a civil case. The judge in the civil case orders an evidenciary hearing on the study. The man who did the study testifies, and the lawyer hired by the NGA then calls Nathan Phelpd to testify. Nathan's lawyer objects, but Judge Donnelly tells Casey to ask for a recess. During the recess, Judge Donnelly tells Nathan's lawyer to let him testify because it will violate his fifth ammendment right not to have to incriminate himself, and the criminal case will have to be dismissed. Nathan is called to testify and the NGA lawyer eventually makes him admit that he hates the man who killed his mother. Nathan's lawyer then asks for a mistrial. The judge in the civil case tells her that she can't ask for a mistrial because it's a hearing, not a trial. She then says that she was asking Judge Donnelly, not him. Judge Donnelly grants the mistrial and Casey asks for the hearing to be dismissed because if there's no trial, there's no need for an evidentiary hearing. The hearing is dismissed and Nathan doesn't have to go to jail and gets a foster family.

In the real apartment, they find the body of lawyer Vicki Riggs, who has been raped and murdered and her engagement ring stolen.Detectives Benson and Stabler initially suspect Vicki's fiancee, as the 911 call reporting the body was made by a male. However, a voice-print comparison shows that he did not make the call.Benson and Stabler then talk to Vicki's boss, wheelchair-bound Tessa McKellen, who says that none of Vicki's cases really would have put her in danger, except for a pro bono case involving dancers at a strip club run by the mob, who were claiming for insurance.The detectives do not suspect a mob hit, but they speak to the manager of the Foreplay Club, only to be told that he and Vicki had come to an arrangement to allow the dancers to have insurance. Part of this arrangement, he reveals, was to give Vicki a job dancing at the club herself!Benson and Stabler talk to Josie Post, another stripper whom Vicki danced with. Josie gives them a lead in the form of Tim, a street vendor who frequents the club and who seems to have an obsession with Vicki.Stabler and Tutuola go to talk to Tim, who tells them that Vicki is his girlfriend and shows them the ring which he intends to use to propose to her. This is Vicki's stolen engagement ring, but Tim denies stealing it. He says that Vicki threw it away behind the club, after her fiancee dumped her.Benson talks to the fiancee, who admits that he knew about her stripping and had called off the wedding, but says that he only lied to protect Vicki's reputation.When Tim's voice also doesn't match that of the 911 caller, they seem to be at a dead end, until Munch shows up with photographs taken of Vicki's building by the film students. The photographs show Vicki entering her building on the night of her murder with another man; her lover.Using a database of driver's licence photos, they compare the facial features of the man in the photo and come up with a match: Linus McKellen, Tessa McKellen's husband.Benson and Stabler go to the McKellen's house where they try to question Linus, but Tessa interrupts. It becomes clear that Tessa, paralysed from a car accident for which Linus feels responsible, is totally reliant on Linus for her care. Stabler notices blood on the jacket that Linus wore in the photograph, but Tessa claims it was a nose bleed. The detectives invite Linus to the squad, and Tessa wants to go with him as his lawyer, but he agrees to go alone.Linus admits to having an affair with Vicki, and to being with her in her apartment the night she died. He says that he left the apartment, but returned five minutes later to retrieve his watch, and found her dead. He called 911.The detectives do not believe that someone else could have killed Vicki in those five minutes, and so Novak says there is enough evidence to indict him. However, Linus' lawyer argues that the ID the detectives made is inadmissable.The lawyer argues to Judge Petrovsky that the method of making IDs based on driver's licence photos is unreliable and not well enough tested to stand up in court. She agrees, and as a result all evidence obtained since that ID (including Linus' confession of being at the scene) are out.The detectives go back to the beginning and look and the McKellen's phone records. They notice that one cell phone records calls to both Vicki Riggs and Josie Post late at night. Benson and Stabler go to Josie's apartment to talk to her about the calls, and break down the door of her apartment to find her raped and murdered.With the door still chained from the inside, the only way the killer could've entered the apartment was through the very high window. The CSU techs determine that the killer entered through a neighbouring building, climbed to the roof, climbed hand-over-hand along a wire to the roof of Josie's apartment building, then sort of abseiled down the side of the building and climbed into Josie's apartment through the window.Although the DNA from Josie's rape kit matches Linus, he denies ever having slept with her but says that he and Vicki sometimes used her apartment to get together. Benson and Stabler start to believe that Linus is innocent, and has been set-up, possibly in an attempt to hurt Tessa, who is reliant on Linus.They go to see Tessa, who is in hospital with pneumonia, and ask her if any of her clients might have a grudge, but she won't break privilege. They delve into her cases anyway and find that she lost a case for a military contract firm called Silverhammer, which was forced to fire employees due to the expense of their loss.Silverhammer give them a list of all the fired employees, one of whom, Walter Inman, has a criminal record for domestic violence and assault. When they attempt to talk to Inman at his apartment, he makes a run for it and abseils out the window, down to the street where Munch and Tutuola are waiting. They manage to arrest him, but not without a struggle.Inman is not about to talk, but Warner reveals that in running extra tests on the DNA from Josie Post's rape kit, she found saliva matching Tessa McKellen mixed with Linus' semen. They realise that Tessa has probably orchestrated the murders. However, Tessa's lawyer argues that her saliva was transferred to Josie by conversion.When they discover that Inman spent his money earned from the two hits on his daughter's college education, Novak is able to get him to talk by promising to allow him to transfer enough of the money to continue to pay his daughter's fees before the money is taken away. He admits to killing Vicki and Josie for Tessa, although he made a mistake in assuming that Linus was having an affair with Josie, also. He also admits to stealing bacteria from a lab for Tessa, too, and has a list in her handwriting of what she wanted. He says that she willingly injected herself with it.Benson and Stabler arrest Tessa, and Huang interviews her. He comes to the conclusion that Tessa has Munchausen's Syndrome, a mental illness where a person pretends to be sick or even makes themself sick to gain attention. This diagnosis gives rise to Tessa's defence, which is that she is psychologically unfit to stand trial. When Tessa gives herself a seizure in the courtroom during the competency trial, the judge agrees with the defence and Tessa is sent to a private hospital.In a bid to expose Tessa's lies and manipulation for what they are, Benson and Stabler visit Linus at their house and ask him whether he had been to the doctor with Tessa recently, and he admits that Tessa hasn't let him go with her in years. Finally realising the truth, Linus grabs Tessa in her wheelchair and pushes her into the indoor swimming pool. She swims to the edge and climbs out, not paralysed after all. Her lies exposed, she can now stand trial for ordering the murders of Vicki Riggs and Josie Post.

The three are arraigned and Novak accuses them of the rape and murder of visiting Canadian student Jennifer Durning, who had disappeared two months earlier. Despite Novak assuring the arraignment judge that they had enough evidence to get an indictment on these charges, the judge decides there is not yet enough evidence to hold them and releases the three teenagers on bail after arraigning them on the charge of endangering the welfare of a minor (for security footage which shows the trio giving underage Jennifer alcohol). Waverly, Pratt and King's parents are easily able to pay bail, and the boys go free.Back in the squad room, Novak admits that they don't actually have enough evidence to charge the trio with rape and murder, but as a tip to the police hotline alerted them to the fact that Waverly was trying to leave the country, they had to act.The detectives run through everything they know about the case so far. Jennifer Durning was at a nightclub with her friend, Dana Simpson, where she met the three boys on the night she disappeared. She left the club with them and later that night returned to her hotel room. She received a phone call shortly afterwards which lured her out of the hotel and she was never seen again. In the early hours of the morning, the trio were seen at a diner, from which they reported their car stolen to police, and the detectives suspect they dumped the car, but can't figure out who would have driven them from Jennifer's hotel to the diner.As they are running Novak through all this, DA Arthur Branch walks in and starts questioning her on why she promised an indictment when there is no evidence. He tells everyone that they had better get a confession or find Jennifer's body soon.As an excuse to get the suspects into the station and to question them, they pretend that the Medical Examiner's Office is closed while it is cleaned for some sort of contamination, and have the ME come and collect DNA from the suspects at the station. While they wait for the MEs to arrive (late, to give the detectives more time), they show the boys footage made at the nightclub by Jennifer's friend, security footage outside the club which shows them all getting into a car together, and security footage from Jennifer's hotel, which shows her clearly upset. They tell them about Dana Simpson's statement; that Jennifer called her when she returned to the hotel and told her she had been gang raped, and that Jennifer's clothes, which she had changed out of when she returned to the apartment, had been tested and had the DNA of three males on them.Jason refuses to say anything to the detectives, despite the evidence, because he refuses to do anything that will get his cousin, Nick Pratt, in trouble. Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly have no such qualms, and are quick to place all the blame on Jason for the rape and the murder.Jason's lawyer pleads with Novak to cut his client a break, insisting that there is no way he is guilty. He mentions that Jason takes piano lessons at Julliard, and Novak realises that the phone call which tipped the police off to Doug Waverly's attempt to leave the country was made from a pay phone near Julliard. Jason admits that he made the call, and tells Novak that after they had dropped Jennifer back off at her hotel, Pratt and Waverly wanted to kill her, but he had left the car at that point.Jason testifies at the grand jury, telling them that he and Jennifer had consensual sex, but that Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly had then raped her. It was Nick's idea to kill her to keep her silence. With his testimony, Novak is able to get and indictment against Pratt and Waverly, and Jason becomes very upset that he betrayed his cousin. His parents decide to take him away to the mountains, to get away from everyone.The DNA evidence comes back- Nick Pratt & Doug Waverly's DNA was on the outside of Jennifer's jeans, consistent with Jason's version of events. But a male pubic hair was also found on the toilet seat in Jennifer's hotel room, which did not match either of them or Jason. Novak decides not to bring it into the case, as it could be unimportant.During the trial, Detective Stabler testifies about the investigation, and the defence lawyers bring up the hair found in the hotel room. Judge Donnelly calls everyone into her chambers, where the defence argue that they have a very good reason for wanting to bring the hair to the jury's attention, and they tell her what it is only once Novak has left the room. It seems to be a valid reason, as Donnelly rules that the hair can be brought in as evidence. In an attempt to find out who the hair might belong to, the detectives start looking through hours of footage from the elevator in the hotel, and Munch spots a man in a coat and hat getting off on Jennifer's floor, who returns to the elevator later carrying Jennifer's coat. They guess that he was able to enter her room by using the key from Jennifer's lost purse, which they weren't able to locate.They locate the man, Keith Willis, who is a well-known local drunk, and who has Jennifer's passport and other belongings in his possession. He is able to identify Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly from their photographs and tells the detectives that they paid him to make a phone call to Jennifer telling her that he had her passport, which lured her out of the hotel. He says that he saw Pratt and Waverly grab her and put her in their car.Unfortunately, Willis is demented, probably from alcohol abuse, and believes it is 1989 and he is a Bulgarian diplomat- not a reliable witness. Stabler and Benson decide to question Jason about whether he remembers seeing Willis that night, but when they arrive at the house his family are renting in the Catskills, they discover that he is missing. No one was supposed to know about his whereabouts, but there are a set of car tracks in the driveway which do not belong to any cars that Waverly and Pratt have access to, and no sign of a struggle.Novak takes the news of Jason's disappearance very hard, as she feels guilty for forcing him to testify. Arthur Branch is furious that there is a leak somewhere which gave away the information about Jason's whereabouts, but they decide that it is not in SVU or the DA's office, which only leaves Judge Donnelly's staff. Branch insists that they can't stop the trial now, because double jeopardy would apply. Novak tries to buy time for the detectives to find Jason by putting a long line of character witnesses on the stand who talk about what a nice girl Jennifer Durning was. The defence tire of it, and Donnelly agrees and gives Novak one day to bring Jason up as a witness.That night, Branch and Novak go to visit Donnelly at her house and make her step outside while they talk, in case there is a bug in her house. They tell her about the leak, and she admits that she doesn't know her staff very well yet. They go to the courthouse and a police tech guy scans Donnelly's chambers, finding a bug placed on the bookshelf, which would have picked up Donnelly mentioning Jason's whereabouts on her Dictaphone. Donnelly says that unfortunately, she cannot rule a mistrial unless they have actual evidence that Jason has met with harm. As Novak has no other witnesses, and the evidence she has presented does not meet the burden of proof, Donnelly has no choice but to dismiss the charges against Pratt and Waverly.Although there is no longer anything they can do to prosecute Jennifer Durning's murder, the detectives begin questioning Donnelly's staff, trying to find out what happened to Jason. They find out that Emily McCooper, a court officer, had been in Donnelly's chambers 'to use the bathroom', and the receiver for the bug was found in her locker. Someone had bought McCooper a new Mercedes, but the detectives were able to track down her old car, and the tires matched the tracks outside the house where Jason was staying and had Jason's blood in it. McCooper admits that she has been sleeping with Nick Pratt and that he had asked her to drive him and Doug Waverly to Waverly's father's produce warehouse.The police guess that they dumped Jennifer's body somewhere near the warehouse, which is their comfort zone. They realize that the diner where they ended up on the night of Jennifer's murder is across the bridge from the warehouse, and they might appear on toll booth camera footage.Munch and Tutuola look through the footage and find Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly in the back of some man's car. They track down the driver, and he tells them where he picked the boys up from. The detectives finally find their original car, which had been towed, in the police impound lot where it had been sitting the whole time. The boot is covered in Jennifer Durning's blood.They go to where the car was originally towed from, and find that it is next to the river. They find Jennifer's shoe, but her body has probably been swept away. They are able to find Jason's body, though, because it snagged on the bridge. The episode ends with Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly being arrested for Jason's murder, just as they were celebrating getting away with Jennifer Durning's murder.

When the woman removes the hood, she reveals a gash on her head with blood coming down the side of her head apparently the result of her head being shaved with a razor. Once taken to an exam room, a social worker (Tonya Majeski) is sent in for her refusal of an exam. Tonya notes that she is bruised and bloody and asks if she has been raped. After confirming her suspicions, she asks if she has notified the police. She offers to place the call for her. The woman refuses all of Tonya's help. Tonya then tries to talk her in to having a rape kit done. When the woman starts to walk out, Tonya concedes and informs her that a doctor will give her the morning after pill and antibiotics.Benson gets out of her car as the woman leaves the hospital. She begins questioning the woman about the attack, but she will not have it. The woman asks her to identify herself. When Benson does, the woman gets angry saying she told the social worker not to call. Benson lets her know that it is not too late to go back in and have a rape kit done and that many women regret not doing it. The woman refuses again. Benson offers to drive her home. The woman then steps to the curb and yells for a taxi. Benson offers the woman her business card, but she refuses it stating she will throw it away and will be needlessly killing trees, which she is against.

Haley assures her that her boyfriend didn't do it and she has not told him about what happened. Once they disturb Haley's neighbor, Haley allows her to enter her apartment. Haley tells her that she still does not want to do anything about the rape. Benson informs her that the perp may be raping and beating someone else. Haley informs her that she does not know who he is and she did not see anything to help identify him. Benson notices the tub full of water and Haley asks her to leave before stepping into the bathroom and shutting the door. As Haley gets ready and get in the tub, Benson explains that once the evidence is washed away it is gone forever. Haley tells her again to leave. Benson looks around noticing a closed door. She opens the door and sees a pile of clothes on the floor. She picks up the panties and deposits them into a plastic evidence bag. Before Benson leaves, she tells Haley she is leaving her business card in case she changes her mind. Haley assures her that she will not.Benson takes the evidence to Melinda Warner in the Medical Examiner's office. Warner explains the evidence is usually logged in at the desk by uniform officers. She surmises the victim must be a V.I.P. for Benson to be the one bringing it in. Benson asks her to make it a priority. Then she explains the perp is a sexual sadist. He beat the victim and shaved her head without a safety razor and she is concerned. Benson then explains that the victim refused a rape kit. Warner is thankful for the evidence obtained. Then she explains how the French Resistance treated their female collaborators. Benson walks out as Warner asks her if she has ever told her about the time she lived in Paris. Captain Cragen walks into the bullpen looking at the newspaper when he notices Benson at her desk wearing the same clothes as the day before. Benson tells him she caught a case and has not returned home. She informs him she has not completed her paperwork but decides to brief him verbally. He asks if she ran the M.O. She had but came up with nothing matching, but she found a picture about The French Resistance on the internet. He is astonished to find that the rapist may have came up with his idea from the History Channel. Benson reminds him that the women tortured in the picture are ones that were doing what the enemy wanted. He asks if the victim's boyfriend could have done it, but she tells him no and there has not been any violent calls received from them. Benson tells him the victim worked at a food co-op. Cragen asks her who the enemy is if the victim is collaborating.Benson goes to the victim's place of employment to question her co-workers. She is told Haley works in vitamins and homeopathics. He tells her all of the employees are co-owners and the objective of the store is community. Benson asks if anyone had given Haley a hard time. He refers to another worker who informs them Haley left early to go to a meeting of a group Haley's boyfriend, Justin, runs.Benson goes to Justin's bookstore to ask him if Haley made it to the meeting. The only response she gets is a lecture about the intrusion of government and The Bill of Rights. She notices a pamphlet on the table, picks it up and asks Justin what CAUSE (Community Activists United Saving Earth) is saving the earth from. He informs her it is about saving the earth from the abuses of human, animal, and environmental rights. She then informs him that Haley was raped the night before. Justin and Benson take their conversation outside the store. She asks him when he last saw Haley. He tells her they split up after the meeting so he could do inventory and another member had taken Haley home. He refused to tell her any names because no one in their group would attack anyone. She asks him for a DNA sample, but he quickly refused citing it as being the ultimate invasion of privacy.Benson returns to Haley's apartment building and speaks with the neighbor they had disturbed. She asks Mr. Delphy if Justin had been there the night before. He explains that he was not and he would have known because of he is always going off about something. She then asks if Haley had any visitors besides her. He says no and he would have heard the dogs barking if she had. He then tells her Haley gave her dogs away and he would not know if she was home or not without them.When Benson reaches Haley's apartment, she notices the door is ajar. She pulls her weapon and enters carefully. She searches the apartment noting the damage that had been done as the result of an intruder. Once she decides it was safe, she re-holsters her weapon and begins looking at a stack of pictures of dead animals. While she is preoccupied, someone walks up behind her, points a gun to her temple, and tells her she wants to see her hands. When Benson tells her she is not there to hurt her, Star Morrison asks if it is her. Benson turns around, recognizes Star, and asks her why the F.B.I. is there. Star tells her that she has to tell her why she is there first.Benson and Star survey the damage done to Haley's apartment. Benson notices the obvious presence of a knife considering the furniture had been slashed. Star notes that there does not seem to be evidence of foul play dues to the lack of blood splatter. She believes the guy was looking for something. When Benson attempts to call CSU, Star informs her the ERT guys are coming to process the scene. Star believes Haley left before her place was trashed since she gave the dogs away. Benson suspects Justin because he will not give his DNA and he seems paranoid. Star informs her the government is watching Justin because of they believe his group CAUSE is helping an eco-terrorist group called EDG (Earth Defenders Group). Benson and Star make their way to a meeting room where a projector is set up. Star shows Benson examples of the trouble EDG has caused while explaining the pictures being seen as an arson spree on SUVs and vandalism of the homes of a pharmaceutical company's employees. She informs her that no one has been hurt yet, but the threat is still there. Then she shows a picture of a new development on Long Island where they put up a sign ""If you build it, we will burn it."" Star also informs her that EDG is not a group to advertise their membership, there is not an official leadership, and they all act independently. All of this makes it hard to infiltrate, but Haley did as an informant. Benson surmises this as the reason Haley's head had been shaved.While in a diner eating, Star informs Benson that Haley started as an informant when she was doing cocaine at 18 and dating a distributor. She helped the feds take down the crew of her boyfriend and a Colombian supplier. Haley had worked that off, but was caught releasing animals from a lab returning her to acting as an informant. Benson believes Haley is informing out of blackmail. Star warns her that sooner or later someone is going to get killed because of these groups playing with explosives and fire. Benson tells Star that Haley was raped because of someone found out she was an informant, making it Star's fault. Benson asks her for the member list, but she refuses saying she will ruin over a year's worth of work. Star reassures Benson she will find the guy who raped Haley. Benson tells her that she has DNA evidence and all it will take is someone finding out they are investigating a rape.Benson and Star pick up Justin and bring him to the precinct under the guise Star works there. Their plan is almost foiled by Fin Tutuola, but he catches on quick. Benson asks Fin to find an empty interrogation room when she spots Warner leaving the squad room. Benson makes her way to Warner only to be greeted by hostility. Warner tell her to let her know what is going on next time before she risks her lab's reputation. She tells her she found a DNA match in the system, but cannot tell her. ADA Casey Novak tells Benson that she told her not to before Cragen yells for Benson to come to his office. Novak holds up Benson's paperwork as she and Cragen inform her of the problem. They inform her it is suspicious the victim is too traumatized to give her statement, but not to give up her panties for evidence. Cragen confirms his suspicion that Benson stole them before he informs her Haley called to complain telling him of the way she had treated Haley. Benson tries to defend herself saying Haley's attacker threatened her into not reporting it and at least they have DNA evidence. Novak informs Benson that Warner cannot release the DNA results because the evidence was obtained illegally. Cragen tells Benson Haley is threatening to sue if the case goes any further. Benson tells them the feds put Haley in with dangerous people. Novak asks why the feds are not handling the case. Benson raises the blinds revealing Star interrogating Justin and tells them they have been working together. Cragen tells Benson to get Star out of there.Benson, Star, and Cragen go upstairs to discuss the situation. Benson informs him of the condition Haley's apartment was in and expresses concern for her safety. Star informs him Haley missed her last check in. Cragen wishes Star luck in finding Haley, but she is not getting Benson's help. Star asks him if they can finish with Justin. He tells her to take him to the Federal Building. She informs him she cannot because Justin thinks she works for SVU. Cragen says to let him go then returns downstairs. Star reminds Benson that Haley's rapist is in the system, she will check it out from her office, and will let her know if she finds anything. When Star returns, she walks out of the elevator to see Stabler discard a can in the trash and calls him on it. He removes the can immediately. Star confirms Cragen's absence before asking if Benson is there. Stabler told her Benson was sent home for sleep. Star decides to fill Stabler in on what she found. Mitchell Hissam had been convicted of statutory rape and he took Haley home. She plays a tape found at Haley's apartment where Mitchell and Haley discuss some plans for Saturday. Stabler asks if she knows where to find Hissam. Star tells him she does and she has a warrant.Star picks the lock on Mitchell's cabin, but Stabler enters first. She thinks he is at a midnight tree hug. Stabler notes the lack of places to hide Haley, but Star hopes to find other things hidden. When Stabler opens a deep freezer, he finds vegetarian foods before picking up a napkin. He opens the napkin carefully revealing dynamite. Star instructs him to return it to its place and informs him if the temperature changes even a little, it will blow. He returns it and they run out. As soon as they are far enough away and think they are in the clear, the cabin explodes throwing them both to the ground. Star notices Stabler is unconscious. After she attempts to wake him, she calls for an ambulance.As the EMTs take Stabler to the ambulance in a neck brace and on a backboard, Stabler tells Star she is a jinx. Every time she comes around he almost gets killed. Star says if she was not around, he might not have lived. Star and Benson go to the local Sheriff's office. The sheriff informs them Mitchell is unlike others in the area and he believes he has set fire to a hunter's cabin before, but he cannot prove it. Benson asks if he has ever seen Mitchell with Haley. The sheriff informs them Mitchell has a girlfriend, Persephone, with an organic greenhouse down the road.Persephone informs Star and Benson she sells seeds over the internet to 200 varieties of heirloom. She ignores Benson's questions telling them she uses organic compost tea to water her plants. After allowing Star to try one, she informs them corporate hybrids are flavorless. Benson shows her a picture of Haley and asks if she has seen her. Persephone pauses her information session long enough to answer no before proceeding to tell them they are now producing square tomatoes and watermelons. Benson informs Persephone of what they suspect Mitchell had done to Haley. She does not believe Mitchell would hurt anyone. Benson tells her about the dynamite. Star tells her she would not like prison because they do not serve organic food there. Benson then informs her she would be going to jail for harboring a domestic terrorist. Star tells her if she goes to jail, her plants will rot. Benson tries again and asks for Mitchell's location. Persephone tells them she was to meet him at Gen-Eng Foods.Benson and Star arrive at Gen-Eng Foods to a demonstration where Star joins in. They locate Justin. A few minutes after they locate Mitchell, federal agents take him away to the precinct. Benson asks where Haley is. He admits he has not seen her since he left her a block from her house after the CAUSE meeting. He informs them he saw Haley get into an SUV with some other guy. Star informs him the FBI has been watching EDG for a while. While they may not make themselves known, they use the internet to brag and post pictures. They show him a picture of  EDG members and show him it could be him. The device used in the explosion was dynamite and they may be able to link it to the one that exploded his cabin. Star informs him that would get him 40 years to life. He informs them they will not be able to miss the upcoming destruction because it will light up the sky. While watching the interrogation, Cragen informs Novak he never looked at the DNA results. Based on the statement Mitchell made, Cragen and Novak head for Warner's office to check the DNA results to see if EDG's plan was motive for Haley's rape. Star calls to have Persephone picked up hoping Mitchell told her what was going on. Benson thinks it would be better to find Haley since she probably knows something. Star says she needs to find out the DNA results. They attempt to go talk to Cragen, but he already left with Novak. At the morgue, Cragen asks if the DNA was Mitchell's. Novak tells Warner if it was not his then no one will ever know they looked. Warner shows them the body of gun shot victim Zander Owens and informs them it was his DNA.Cragen brings Benson into his office to share his new found information with her. Benson and Cragen realize Haley did not want them to do anything about her rape because she wanted to kill him. Benson asks if Zander could be a member of EDG, but Cragen did not find anything in his file to support that. When Cragen informs her Zander was recently released from the federal pen, she realizes he was the one Haley had sent to jail.Benson goes to the FBI to meet up with Star. Star introduces her to Agent Lockwood. Star confirms Zander was Haley's boyfriend. Lockwood informs her Haley did not testify against him. Star tells him he messed up because of the situation Haley was in. Lockwood informs Benson Haley did not know Zander was being released. Star tells her they do not tell each other classified information. Lockwood tells Benson Zander's DNA was in the system for a prison gang rape. Haley calls Star requesting to meet her.Star meets Haley at a health food juice bar. Haley says she had something personal to take care of before she contacted Star again. She claims her haircut was in protest of a shampoo manufacturer. Benson comes up behind her and tells her she is not bald because of a protest. Then she tells her she is under arrest for the murder of Zander Owens. Star stops Haley as she gets up to leave. Benson tells her to tell them about EDG's next attack.In an interrogation room, Haley lets them know she at least partially blames Star for her rape. Star apologizes for it. They both ask her why she would not let them handle it. She informs them she had taken some drug money when Zander was arrested and gave it to charity. The only reason Zander let her live was because she led him to believe she could get the money. Star tells her that since she took a life, she know Haley wants to make amends. In order to make things right, she needs to tell them what EDG has planned since the tape recorder went out before Mitchell gave details. Haley informs them the details are not given ahead of time only pick up points are given. Benson asks how Persephone was involved. She tells them she supplies the fertilizer before telling them she has to bring the diesel fuel and she is willing to wear a wire. Star tells her they will follow her. Novak comes in and tells them she is not releasing her because she committed murder. Benson tells her this is their only way to find out where they are going to attack next. Star informs her the mixture of fertilizer and diesel creates an explosion as bad as Oklahoma City. Novak wants Haley to wear an ankle bracelet, but Star says Haley will have a cop with her. Haley assures Benson no one has met Persephone as they walk up to a bearded guy named Russ beside subway stairs. Haley introduces the two. At the bottom of the stairs, Mitchell asked to see what Persephone brought. She opens her backpack to reveal a bag of ammonium nitrate. He tells them Andy Dell, one of the founding members of EDG, is already at the target. They walk to another set of stairs and up to get into a waiting van. The van stops outside of Gen-Eng Foods. They all climb out and are let into the building by a security guard, who gives them fifteen minutes to accomplish the task. Benson, Haley, and Russ take the elevator to the floor containing the CEO's office. Russ tells them how to get to the office and tells them to meet him in the lobby in ten minutes.As they walk towards the door, Benson calls for the feds to arrest the guys downstairs, but before she could finish her transmission, Haley hits her on the head knocking her to the ground. Haley picks up Benson's weapon before she goes into the office. When Benson regains her footing, she calls back to the feds to get upstairs because there is a problem. Benson enters the office with caution to see Haley beginning to assemble the bomb on the desk. Benson asks where Andy Dell is. Haley informs her that he was the security guard. While Benson tries to calm her down, Haley tells Benson Dell infiltrated Gen-Eng. Mitchell was the bomb expert but you learn how to do it on the internet. Haley tells Benson to go back downstairs as Star enters gun drawn. Star tells Haley to put the gun down. Haley tells her she is making a statement because the company's food is unsafe and they test on animals. Benson keeps trying to talk her into stopping. Haley tells them she will not let them take her to jail. Star tells her she cannot let her set the bomb off. Haley tells them to leave again. When she does not stop, Star shoots and kills her. Benson tells her they could have stopped her without killing her. Star tells her to never second-guess a terrorist.To keep up the charade, Star led Benson out in make shift cuffs. Star reassures Benson Haley never had the chance to tell them she was a cop and the proof of that is that no one ran. She helps Benson into the van with the members of EDG to be taken to Federal lock up. Benson tells Russ the feds killed Haley. Russ tells Benson Dell got away.Once out of the holding cell and in an interrogation room, Star asks Benson if she had any information on Andy Dell. Benson informs her he is heading back to Oregon. Star tells her Persephone and Mitchell are in isolation in prison. When Benson asks why, Star tells her they want her to keep up the undercover operation. Benson tells her she has a job. Star plays the guilt trip of Haley to get her to agree.Stabler walks into the squad room to Munch and Fin welcoming him back. He looks at Benson's cleaned off desk and asks Cragen where she is. Cragen cannot tell him anything except she has been temporarily reassigned and he is getting a new partner. Stabler clarifies it will be a  temporary partner. Then he calls her and hears her phone has been disconnected."

The children tell them the missing girl, Janey, gets picked on a lot and the missing boy, Connor, acts as her bodyguard. When Stabler speaks with their teacher, she is upset that she did not know the students were missing until the curator of the museum tells her their recorders were missing. She explains that Janey looks younger than she actually is because she has Turner's Syndrome. The detectives use the museum's tracking system for the recorders and locate Connor's outside in the bushes along with a bloody shoe. Cragen informs them a ransom call has been received by Connor's parents demanding $300 to be delivered to an arcade.Outside the arcade, Munch brings Cragen coffee to the car and tells him that Janey's parents have yet to receive a ransom call. He also tells him her father left for Vancouver. Tutuola informs them the money is still in place just before Stabler describes a possible suspect. Tutuola watches at the boy fakes tying his shoe and reaches for the bag containing the money. They both approach him. He states that he is to be paid $50 for picking it up and delivering it. After being threatened with jail time, he tells them where he was to make the delivery. Tutuola and Stabler bust into an apartment containing three boys, one of which being Connor. Once they threaten the boys with 5 years in jail, they find that Connor set his kidnapping up in order to obtain the money he lost in a bet. They escort Connor to the station to continue their questioning. He tells them Janey stayed at the museum. He further tells them Janey did not have problems with her father and she has not seen her mother since she was little. He says her problem revolve around the kids at school. The detectives, Cragen, and Huang watch a video of student elections that illustrates the torment Janey went through. Huang tells them Turner Syndrome patients are intelligent, but they are trapped in the bodies of children. Cragen tells Stabler that Munch will work with TARU to view the museum's tapes and sends him to talk with Janey's grandfather. Stabler tells him he will take Tutuola along as he leaves his office. Cragen rushes to catch up with him to let him know they are looking for a new partner for him. Stabler insists he is fine with the way things are until Benson gets back. Stabler turns in time to see his daughter. Kathleen tells him he ruined her relationship with Kevin. He tells her he does not want her seeing him again. She informs him that her mother thinks he is overreacting. He simply says he will discuss it with her mother later, but she is going to be late for school so he will drive her. She takes off into the elevator as she says, ""I hate you!""Tate Speer, Janey's grandfather, informs Tutuola and Stabler that he usually keeps Janey away from field trips, but he allowed her to go this time because she begged him and he thought she would be safe at a museum. Mr. Speer shows them to Janey's room. While they look around, he tells them the only enemies the family might have now would be from a recent layoff, but all of the people were given severance packages. When they ask him about Janey's mother, he says she is a drunk. Stabler takes Janey's laptop even though Mr. Speer informs him she is only allowed 10 minutes a day on the internet. He is adamant that someone kidnapped her while they ask questions as if they believe she may have ran away. Tutuola receives a call requesting their presence with TARU. When they arrive, Munch shows them a tape of Connor leaving through the back of the building. Then he shows them tape of Janey being approached by a stranger and receiving a package from them before following the person out the door. Morales enlarges the picture to reveal the logo on the woman's work shirt. Tututola and Stabler locate the woman at work and ask if she knows Janey. She informs them that she is her mother. As far as she knows, Janey is at school. When she begins saying Janey's father must have done something to her, they escort her to the station for further questions. At the station, she states that Janey asked her to bring baby pictures to her at the museum for a school project. They inform her Janey's father left for Vancouver alone. She tells them she filed for joint custody after 3 years of sobriety. She says that Janey told the judge in the case she wanted to live with her mother. She also lets them know Janey's father took her to Vancouver to check out schools.Cragen informs them a witness called believing she may have seen Janey being pushed into a silver Lexus SUV, which is what the family owns. Tutuola and Stabler find out from her grandfather that Greg Hartley last used the vehicle to drive her to school. They go to the parking garage and verify the vehicle is there. When Stabler spots the security camera, he states he wants to verify if it has moved since taking Janey to school. Upon viewing the tape, they find the vehicle had been moved by someone unknown to the family. This arms them with a suspect's picture before the lab calls requesting their presence.Siper states they found Janey's backpack, but there were a lot of fingerprints. Inside the backpack, they found a tube of experimental testosterone gel. Warner informs them Dr. Alexander Shulman is the one running tests on it. She requests to tag along so she can find out why a 17-year-old has possession of a drug used to increase her sex drive.Dr. Shulman states he is trying to help girls with Turner's Syndrome because they have less time to procreate than normal girls. He also informs them Janey was involved in the study with her mother's consent. When they approach her mother with this information, she defends her position stating her father wants to keep Janey a little girl. She just wants to show Janey the real world safely under careful supervision. When she tells them Janey uses her laptop instead of going out with boys, Stabler takes it for TARU to check. He shows her the picture of the suspect and she denies knowing him.Morales finds that Janey was running her mother's computer through her dad's. She visited sex and lingerie sites. He was also able to locate e-mails she exchanged with Connor planning his fake kidnapping. She located a guy named Dan online to help her with running away. When they locate Dan, they learn Janey sent him a copy of the key to the vehicle and told him where to pick her up. He was paid $200 to take her to another location. After dropping her off, he returned the vehicle, but she never told him what to do with the key. He gave Tutuola and Stabler the key as well as the money he was paid.Tutuola, Stabler, and Cragen update Huang on the case and ask him what he believes is going on. He says that while it may look like she is the one doing the planning, he believes someone is manipulating her. They discuss that only a pedophile would enjoy having sex with a 17-year-old who looks 12 because he would be living his fantasy only legally. Huang tells them to start with those closest to her. Janey's father, Nathan is brought to the station and is met by his lawyer, Van Allen. When Stabler confronts him with pictures from the web sites Janey visited, he claims they must have popped up when she was researching another subject. When told about the testosterone, he says her mother got her started in all of it. He states she was happy with her life until her mother showed back up in her life. He also tells him that Janey's mother forced her to tell the judge she wanted to live with her. As he and his lawyer were leaving, Janey's mother walks in asking what he did with Janey. They get into a heated argument before Nathan storms out saying she will never get her hands on Janey. Novak informs Cragen that Van Allen is an immigration lawyer and specializes in custody cases where one parent is a foreigner. Munch interrupts them saying phone logs from the Speer home shows several calls to Annabelle Paz, a travel agent.When Tutuola and Stabler question Paz, they find Mr. Speer is planning a trip with his daughter to an island under French or British control, but when they show her a picture of the family she points to Greg Hartley saying he is Mr. Speer. When they arrive at the Speer house, Hartley had left. They try his apartment, but the only thing they find is a pair of boots with a yellow powdery substance embedded in the sole. While at the station, they get the lab report stating the substance on the boot is marble dust from marble imported from Italy. After calling the grandfather, they learn one of the family's hotels is being renovated with a marble floor. When they arrive at the hotel, they find her hurt and crying. As she is taken away in the ambulance, they spot Hartley in the crowd of spectators. Stabler makes his way behind him while Tutuola approaches him from the front. When they arrest him, he asks if she is alright. Upon returning to the station, Stabler is told Kathy is there to talk with him. She tells him Kathleen locked herself in her room and wants to know why. Stabler reminds her they agreed the guy is no good for Kathleen. She, then, reminds him they were suppose to talk to her together. She inquires as to why he has not signed the divorce papers. All he can say is ""I don't know."" Before she leaves, she tells him to call Kathleen.While Tutuola and Stabler question Hartley, he claims the sex with Janey was consensual. She visited the sites on her own. She bought lingerie on her own. She asked him to have sex with her. He states he loves her and would never hurt her. Novak reminds them that sex with a 17-year-old is legal.  At the hospital, the doctor informs Stabler and Janey's parents they had to remove an ovary. He also tells them Janey had been taking Menopur, a fertility drug, and abuse of the drug will make it harder for her to get pregnant. When they ask Janey about the drug, she tells them she wants to have a baby because she does not have much time left to have children. When her parents get into a fight, Stabler asks them to leave. Janey tells him she loves Hartley and he loves her for her. She tells him Hartley had left her at the hotel to get her some pain pills. Huang is the only one to agree with Janey. Tutuola receives a call saying a patrol was sent to the Speer house. When they arrive, Hartley was there saying the family tried to buy him off. Janey told her grandfather she was going to go live with Hartley when she's better. Stabler and Tutuola tell her father to petition the court for a PINS (Person In Need of Supervision) order that will be good until she turns 18. When Nathan asks if they will testify, Stabler tells him they will need something to testify about and inquires about any checks they did on him when they hired him. In court, Stabler testifies that Janey should not be allowed to have a relationship with Hartley because she does not know him. He was fired from his last job because of a relationship with his employer's daughter. Janey's lawyer reminds him no charges were filed in the case so it was not relevant. She states that he is prejudiced because of his daughters. The judge asks Janey what her plans are. When she tells him of finishing her education, getting a job, and living arrangements, he allows her to leave with Hartley.Outside the courthouse Dani Beck spots them kissing and places Hartley under arrest when Stabler informs her it is legal. She introduces herself as his new partner. He tells her, ""Welcome to the world of gray."""

Campanella|3|164|2006-10-03 00:00:00|8005|Recall|14300000.0|Jonathan Greene|8|svu|http://www.tv.com/shows/law-order-special-victims-unit/recall-875075/recap|http://www.tv.com|"Beck and Stabler are forced to stop chasing a running perp from their car when they come to a fence. With the perp still in their sights, they continue the pursuit on foot through a parking lot where he temporarily takes shelter before running through the streets and losing them. When O'Halloran arrives, Stabler has him dust the Jaguar and the Chevy the perp was hiding between for prints. Beck and Stabler meet up with the victim, Nikki, at the hospital. Stabler tells her they are there to help her.When Beck and Stabler arrive at the precinct, Munch informs them the victim requested a Ginger Ale, but he cannot find one. When he inquires as to how bad the attack was, Stabler tells him ""M to P and P to V"" before having to explain their meaning to Beck. Beck questions about how many perps they actually catch and how many are serial rapist before Stabler asks her if she is ready to interview the victim. Beck tells him she will run the MO through the system while he interviews the victim.Nikki tells Stabler he forced her to get on her knees and perform oral sex on him before slamming her against the wall and raping her from behind. When he was finished he wiped her down with wet naps that have alcohol in them. In the next room, Tutuola tells Cragen no evidence was found at the scene. Nikki then tells Stabler the perp was probably in his 40s, has a backwards L-shaped scar on his hand, and she will try to describe him to a sketch artist, but it was dark. After Stabler informs Cragen the uniforms could not find the perp, Cragen has him close the door and asks about Beck. When Stabler tells him they are in sink with each other, Cragen warns him to keep an eye on her. The talk is that Beck was overzealous in Warrants so she was kicked off the team. Beck interrupts them to let them know O'Halloran called with a hit from the prints. They belong to Barry Cole, an ex-con. Cragen sends them to pick him up.Beck tells Stabler she was born in Denmark. She explains that she met her husband while she was studying in Germany while he was stationed there in the military. When they were married, she moved to the states. He explains he and Benson had been partners for seven years, but she was pulled to do an undercover assignment. When she tells him she was in Warrants for 3 ½ years, he asks if she just got tired of it. With the question left unanswered, they arrive at Cole's apartment. After a few pounds, the occupant allows them access to the apartment. She denies Cole was there, but Stabler sees him running away when he looks out the window. Once they catch Cole, Beck tells Stabler his attire slows him down.When Beck and Stabler arrive at the station, O'Halloran pulls Stabler aside to inform him Beck left out part of his conversation with her. He told her he was not finished processing the prints. He called the car rental agency the Jaguar belongs to and found Cole is one of their employees. Cole's prints were found on the passenger side of the Jaguar, while the perp was on the driver's side holding on with all ten fingertips. When he ran those prints, he found they belong to Martin Trenway, a former ADA. Stabler thanks him for saving them and goes to confront Beck. Stabler tells her to cut Cole loose before Cragen finds out.Trenway explains he rented the car for a deposition in Jersey. He tells them he has receipts from the Holland Tunnel if they want to see it. When Stabler notices his bandaged wrist and asks about it, he claims he hurt it playing basketball with his son. When Beck complains Trenway has an answer for everything, Stabler tells her he just wants to check for the scar. In the squad room, Beck tells the team Trenway looks a lot like the sketch. When Cragen clarifies the sketch probably resembles about 10,000 other guys as well, Beck reminds him Trenway was the one whose fingerprints were found on the Jag. Cragen tells them if they go after Trenway, they have to have everything in order. Beck informs the team Trenway is 54 and grew up in Douglaston, Queens. He attended Cardosa High School, Cornell, Duke Law School. He has been married to the same woman for 30 years and has two sons. He currently lives in Stanford, Connecticut. Beck reminds them he is a lawyer so he knows how to get rid of evidence. Cragen tells her middle-aged men do not suddenly start attacking women. When Novak tells them she wants Trenway in a line-up, Beck suggests a hand line-up since Nikki did not get a good look at his face. Stabler and Novak take Nikki into the line-up. Stabler tells the men to make a fist and keep their hands still. Nikki stops in front of Trenway's hand before Stabler escorts her out.Trenway explains the scar is from tendon transfer surgery, but many people have one just like it. He claims he left work around midnight and they can check the security tapes. Beck tells him the security guard says he left at 9:45 and returned around 11. Stabler informs him that is the time frame of the rape and chase. He explains it away saying many people are out at that time of night. They tell him his prints were on the outside of the Jag, but he tries to say he tried to say he dropped his briefcase and bent down to pick it up, but Beck demonstrated that would not have been possible.As Beck, Stabler, and Novak make their way down the courthouse steps, Beck complains that$25,000 bail is a joke. Stabler hopes he will rape again before he goes to trial. When Beck notices the media, she goes over and tells them of Trenway's charges sending them running to get their story. Trenway tries to explain it away as a case of mistaken identity.While Stabler looks at the newspaper with Trenway on the cover, Tutuola introduces Heather Stark to Beck. When Beck brushes her off, Stabler steps in and takes her to an interview room. Heather gives Stabler details of her rape 5 years prior. She claims she knows Trenway was the man who raped her.When Stabler walks Heather back to the squad room, she sees Beck taping pictures of her beaten body to the board. Stabler has Munch take her to make a call in private while he goes to the board and takes them down explaining she does not need to see how she looked that night. Cragen tells Stabler the MO's of Heather and Nikki's attacks are similar. Novak tells them Heather's ID will be considered tainted since she pick him out of the newspaper instead of a line-up. Stabler informs them her rape kit was inventoried and the statute of limitations for Heather's rape expires in 4 days. Cragen sends Stabler and Beck to obtain the rape kit and tells Novak to get a warrant for Trenway's DNA.At the property clerk's warehouse, they are told the building leaks so bad they constantly have to move things from their designated spot and it will take several weeks to find it. When Beck insults the clerk, he tells her she can find the evidence herself. As soon as they get outside, Stabler asks if she has a friend that can undo her mess for her. He gives her a few rules to go by to get their job done: get inside people's heads, not every perp is the same, and never turn your back on a victim.In court, Heather tells she had a fractured skull as well as a broken nose and eye socket. Even though she is unable to tell the court why she did not call the police any of the other times Trenway was in the paper, some ground is recovered when Novak has a defense expert agree that since Heather's composite after the event could be Trenway. When the judge breaks for lunch, Stabler notices Trenway get agitated when he sees a woman sitting in the back of the courtroom.Warner tells Novak, Beck, and Stabler that because of the evidence getting wet mold had formed on the biological material. She informs them she was able to get enough of the biological material to get DNA. When Novak gets prematurely excited, she disappoints her saying Trenway's DNA did not match that of Heather's rapist.After they let Heather know the DNA did not match, she yells at Trenway when he tries to approach her. Stabler tries to tell her they will find her rapist, she reminds him it is too late. Novak informs Beck the only way to get Trenway now without making him look like a martyr is to find another victim who can say he raped her.Cragen asks Stabler how far back they need to go to find this witness Novak wants. He tells him they need to go as far back as they can and that all Novak wants is a witness to put on the stand under Molineaux to establish he has raped before. Munch and Tutuola meet them at the squad doors and tell them Beck has been there all night. When Stabler inquires, Beck tells him they have Trenway. She explains that between 1970 and 1974, there were 14 attacks on women in Ithaca. The attacks stopped when Trenway left Cornell to go to Duke Law School. From August of '74 to May of '77, there were 11 rapes in North Carolina and they stopped when Trenway left Duke to return to New England. She further explains she believes they will find more attacks closer to New York because Trenway visits clients in New Jersey and lives in Connecticut. Beck tells the team she pulled 2 assaults from '67 to '70 when Trenway was a teenager in Douglaston. One is ruled out because a man was attacked. The other is Lorraine Delmas who suffered a broken nose, cheekbone, and jawbone. Cragen notes the photos could be carbon copies of Nikki West.When Stabler and Beck arrive at Miss Delmas's home, Stabler realizes she is the woman in court that freaked out Trenway. She explains Marty's mother and she were best friends growing up. They met brothers and moved to the states, but while Marie got married she did not. She tells them she promised Marie on her deathbed that she would watch after Marty. When she claims she and Marty lost touch when he went to college, Stabler informs her he knows about her attack and he believes she knew her attacker. They take her to the station to ask her more questions. While observing Stabler's interview with Delmas, Huang tells Cragen she went to court to see Marty get justice. He then tells them she will not talk to a man. Beck interrupts Stabler's attempts and begins talking with Miss Delmas in French. When Stabler leaves, Beck tells her that her husband was murdered in the line of duty 4 years prior. She tells her once she started talking about it, she felt much better. Delmas tells Beck Marty was the one who attacked her.In court, Miss Delmas announces Marty raped her for the first time. After the judge tells Miss Delmas she cannot allow her testimony because there is no evidence to support her story, she tells them she hid her clothes in a box between the beams in her basement. Stabler locates the box and takes them to Warner, who confirms Trenway raped both Delmas and Nikki West. Delmas tells the court if she had spoken up Marty may not have harmed Nikki. She goes on to apologize to Nikki. Novak tells them Trenway will plead guilty and name all of his victims in exchange for the maximum sentence. Beck tells Delmas if he ever gets out of prison, he will be too old to rape anyone. Nikki asks how she can repay Miss Delmas. She tells her to move on with her life. After she thanks Beck, Miss Delmas walks out of the courtroom with the pep back in her step."

He explains a co-worker called it in saying she had not made it in to work. As they enter the room, he tells them the victims are mother and daughter. Stabler lifts up the sheet noting they are wrapped in clear tape. Beck notes the breasts and genitals are slashed. After seeing them covered in sheets, Stabler asks if the officer found them this way explaining it is not typical behavior. The officer tells them he got the sheets from the linen closet out of respect. When Stabler notices the girl is holding something in her hand, he tells Beck to help him. Beck reluctantly complies asking if they should wait for the ME. As soon as he tells her no, he tells her to hold the wrists. As he pries the hand open he estimates the time of death being 12 hours prior. He pulls out a crucifix from her hand. Beck locates a picture showing the necklace on the mother. She assumes the girl was reaching for her mother and praying for the help that never came.When Cragen arrives, Beck quickly explains she needed some air. She explains the building does not have a doorman, but the perp would have had to be buzzed in. When Cragen tries to explain a theory of the attack, Beck interrupts him poking holes in his theory and adding her own. She tells him the victim was a quiet single mother with no boyfriends and she worked for a law firm for businesses as a receptionist. She shows him all of the hardware thinking she was trying to keep someone out. Stabler explains the hardware is normal for a single mother in the city. Cragen theorizes the girl might have known the perp. Warner chimes in saying she does not see how anyone that would do this would be a friend to either one of the victims. She explains the vaginal trauma was worse on the girl, but that was probably due to her age. She tells them both females were assaulted in the exact same manner. When Beck asks if there could have been two perps, Warner informs them the perp cleaned them up so they will not have DNA to find out. Stabler approaches Beck quietly and tells her everyone loses it with their first kid case. When she tells him she will get used to it, he tells her when she does she needs to transfer out. They find a past due bill and a pay-stub from Folsom, Young, and Klein.Munch and Tutuola speak with someone at the firm. They are told Gabby's daughter was hospitalized with asthma. The bills were turned over to a collection agency so she borrowed from $500 a month from petty cash, but replaced it before the accounts were reconciled. She also informed them Gabby's landlord offered to subsidize her rent, but she never took him up on the offer.Beck and Stabler haul in Gabby's landlord. Beck asks if he offered to give her free rent in exchange for sex. He tells her in America it is called quid pro quo. Stabler informs him the NYPD calls it solicitation. He tells them that since she never did him then it was no harm no foul. When he asks Beck if she was ever with a guy who paid everything for her, she tells him no. Then he asks if she was ever married. Without an answer from her, he continues saying she banged a guy for a couple of years and is now getting alimony. She takes out her gun and walks over to him putting it sideways in his face telling him her husband's killer is in Attica. She removes the clip and tells Stabler she is going to put it in her locker. When Stabler asks how much he was knocking off her rent to bang her daughter, he tells him he is not a pervert. He informs him the only reason Gabby turned him down is she found a sugar daddy named Williams.When they go to the tennis club to speak with Mr. Williams, he tells them he and Gabby never had a relationship. Beck and Stabler suppose a relationship between the receptionist and a lawyer may be frowned upon. Mr. Williams explains she is probably worth more than he is. Beck informs him she needed money. He tells her Gabby never asked him for a penny. When he informs them another associate at the firm set up this tennis match weeks ago, Stabler tells him to ask for a rain check so he can come to the station and answer some questions. He reminds them he went to law school and he does not have to come with them before heading to his game. After Stabler tells Beck they will wait for him, Beck tells him she is not patient and tennis is boring. She walks to the microphone and asks Mr. Williams if they would  find his DNA on any of her clothes causing him to run back up the stairs to them. He tells them they had sex once in his office. When Beck tells him they have a witness placing him at her apartment, he explains Gabby wanted him to meet her daughter so he took them on a picnic where she told him she loved him. Before he could break up with her, she panicked about a homeless guy hugging her daughter. And her daughter's friend, Lupe, told them not to hurt him because he is their friend.Stabler and Beck speak with Lupe. She tells them they took the guy everyday. She explains he thanks them by hugging them. Stabler asks her to take them to meet him. Lupe's mother tells them they should lock up all of the homeless. Stabler tells her they do not know if the guy did anything or not. Lupe makes sure they are not going to hurt him before telling them they followed him to the spot where he sleeps as she points to a tunnel. They decide to search the cardboard box and find an old man. Stabler explains the guy does not fit the profile because of his age and the fact the perp was organized. Beck forces the guy awake and notices his hand is bleeding. While she searches him for weapons, Stabler looks over the box and notices he has clippings of SVU cases hanging up.In the interrogation room, Beck asks the homeless guy if he is a pervert or if he is a fan of Stabler's. While she goes through the clippings, Stabler tells her a little about the cases. Huang dictates his profile while copying pictures saying the perp likes to inflict pain to cause the victim's suffering that arouses him. When Beck shows him a picture of the little girl, she slides his chair back quickly being stopped by Stabler pushing him back to the table. A sadistic killer draws out his kills to last. He is most likely a white middle forbidden>Stabler arrives at the psychiatric hospital and asks Beck if Munch has arrived. She tells him he is already inside. Beck tells him she cannot go inside. Stabler reminds her Munch reached out to them. When she refuses, Stabler enters alone. Munch asks him to tell Andrew he was not responsible. Stabler tells him he had a psychotic break. Munch tells Andrew he will have to stand trial, but they will find him not guilty by reason of temporary insanity and send him back there to get better. Stabler tells him to take his medication. Andrew tells them he does not want any medication. He tells them he is responsible and must pay for what he did. He tells Munch he just wants to say goodbye. He tells him goodbye and walks off down the hall.

He collects the sheets and bags them before leaving with the items. She watches him leave before gathering her clothes and dressing. As she begins following him, she calls Stabler to let him know she was raped again by the same guy. He tells her not to follow him, but is told he will get away again. Stabler calls for help as she is confronted and killed by her rapist. When Stabler arrives on the scene, he calls Beck – who is at Attica. After telling her the situation, she tells him she is a five hour drive away and asks where to meet him – crime scene or hospital. He glances at the body in front of him and tells her the morgue.ME Warner arrives at the crime scene to Stabler checking out the body. Stabler tells identifies the 30-year-old white victim and tells her she was raped 17 days prior with the rape kit being negative for semen. She asks him if the rapist came back for more. He tells her this is what happens when civilians take the law into their own hands. When Warner tells him that does not sound like him, he explains the bruises around her neck are from her impact baton and she was following the guy. Warner explains there are no petechial hemorrhages so she was not strangled. She guesses the cause of death is blunt force trauma because of the cranial injuries. He informs her the victim called the rape crisis center and went to meetings to get her life back.At Elizabeth's apartment, CSU tells Munch and Tutuola there were no fingerprints, no fluids, one hair, but they still have to vacuum and sift. Munch tells her the rapist beat her to it from the marks on the carpet. Tutuola notes he took the bedding and the trash. They notice the broken window. While Tutuola assumes she heard the glass break, Munch tells him most rape victims have to take something to sleep. When CSU tells them they only found the usual over-the-counter meds and a well-stocked liquor cabinet, Munch tells them toxicology will tell them what she took.Stabler informs Huang and Cragen the perp is a white male, 5'11"" to just over 6 foot, 180 pounds, brown eyes, brown hair with no visible tattoos or scars. Beck joins the meeting. Stabler continues telling them he held a knife to her throat and wanted to know how she liked to be touched. Huang informs them he is a power-reassurance rapist. Stabler tells them the foreplay was rough and prolonged and the details were clear. She walked him through it for over an hour with no breaks or tears.  In her interview with him, she tells him she was raped maybe 5 times over 36 hours and 47 minutes. He tells her she did good by surviving. The perp tried to make her squat into a cup; when she could not, he cut her face; she finally gave it up. He made her get in the tub where he scrubbed her raw inside and out. Before he left he told her he would see her later.-- Huang thinks he may have drank her urine. He did not wear a condom because he had plenty of time to play. He knew her habits and took total control over her. Beck tells them there is no way this guy is a first timer. Stabler decides to check 61s and Vi-CAP for similar MOs. Cragen tells them to check the 61s in other boroughs to see if he moved around.While Stabler is coming up empty, Beck finds one case in Park Slope where the suspect description and MO match. She is briefly interrupted to deny charges on a call from Attica from one of her husband's killers. She tells him how her husband died. Two fifteen year olds were pulled over in a stolen car. One had a bench warrant. They shot him in the head while she was sitting in their favorite restaurant fuming. When she got home and saw the brass at the door, she knew he was dead. He was shot by two morons who did not have the sense to ditch the gun. The shooter was killed in a prison fight. When Stabler questions why she would refuse to accept the guy's calls but she would drive five hours for a face-to-face meeting, Beck tells him she went to see the killer's body. They are interrupted by another match Celeste Mott, 27, in Queens and Gina Maylor, 32, in Brooklyn. They leave to see if their stories match.Gina tells Stabler and Beck the perp had offered to help her with her groceries, but insisted when she refused. He was friendly and good-looking. He pulled a knife at her door, stayed for two days, and made her pee in a cup. When he put her in the tub, he bathed, douched, and humiliated her. He told her he would see her around and took the cup with him. He raped her again 10 days later. She woke up to him sitting on her chest. She denies hearing the bedroom window break. When Beck questions if she had taken something or was drunk, Gina thinks she does not believe her like the other cop. She explains he told her rapists do not strike the same victim twice. It made her feel raped all over again so she did not even bother reporting the third rape.Cragen and Stabler confront the detective who caught Gina's case. He informs them her story was not supported by evidence and it kept changing. The window was broken from the inside. He reminds them most rapists do not attack the same victim twice. He tells them he has other more pressing cases to work so do not tell him how to do his job. When Stabler believes the guy is just trying to pass the blame, Cragen reminds him he worked the case by the book. When they return to the squad room, Beck informs them they have another match. White female under forty. Elizabeth was raped twice. Gina was raped three times. Celeste Mott was raped twice that they know of, but she moved with no forwarding address. Beck informs them they were all raped 17 to 23 days apart. Megan Carlisle,32, raped once five months ago. When Cragen points out that does not work with the MO, Beck tells him everything else is the same and she should have been raped three times by now. Stabler guesses she did not report the other rapes. Cragen tells them to go find out, but to go easy on her.When Beck and Stabler arrive at the Carlisle residence,  a pregnant Megan answers the door. She allows them in after they inform her they have not caught the guy yet while calling for her husband. They tell her they have new leads on the case. They believe the guy who attacked her rapes his victims again, except for her. When Megan claims she must be unattractive to the guy now, Stabler informs her rape is about power and rage. When Beck informs them she should have been raped again around the time she conceived, they are promptly kicked out. Before they leave, Stabler apologizes for upsetting them.On there way out, Beck asks Stabler if he has anything to say. When she gives him some examples, he tells her he knows she was lying. Beck tells him Megan is so desperate to have a child she is willing to protect her rapist. When she asks him if that is twisted, he tells her his old partner is a child of rape. She reminds him there were no options then. When he asks if she is trying to say it was easy for Benson's mother, she tells him she means decisions are simple when there is no choice. She reminds him since they have no forensic evidence, then the baby could give them the DNA if he was the sperm donor.At the precinct, Beck fills Cragen and Huang in on her theory about the pregnancy. Cragen reminds her they have to have Megan's full cooperation. Stabler tells them all of the rapes do not occur within the 17 to 23 day time period, because Gina was raped ten days later. Huang informs them the time line coincides with the victim's menstruation cycles. When Stabler questions the suspect's desire to impregnate his victims, Huang reminds him he only collects the urine once and he does not drink it because he is testing it to find out when they will ovulate. When Cragen wonders about the theory, Huang informs him men have a desire to procreate as well. Stabler reminds him there is birth control and the morning after pill. Huang reminds him the guy stays there so he will know what is the their medicine cabinet. Beck reminds them the morning after pill has to be taken within 72 hours. Stabler realizes the perp stays with them to give his sperm enough time to swim upstream. Beck believes the scrubbing is to make sure they do not catch any strays. Stabler realizes they do not look deep enough. When Huang tells them autopsies do not consist of reproductive tissue resection, Cragen tells them he will call Warner. Munch and Tutuola interrupt them to let them know they found glass in the alley under the victim's bedroom window and the buildings are managed by the same company. Cragen sends Munch and Tutuola to find out who has access to the master keys.At Ensor Property Management, Munch and Tutuola are told they have 500 employees and 140 of them have access to the master keys. When they show a list of addresses, they are told they all share the same property manager Ted Wilmington. He is looking at another piece of property.When Munch and Tutuola bring Wilmington into the interrogation room, he tells them over a hundred people have access to the master keys and they have the wrong guy. He tells them people do not have to like him as long as they do as he says after they ask if he has any enemies. He tells them he does not have to rape anyone. He is not relationship material so he takes what he wants. Tutuola tells him that sounds like rape and asks for a hair sample. Since he does not think it sounds like fun, he asks if he needs a lawyer.When Tutuola carries in two boxes with Munch walking beside him, Stabler asks what it is. They tell him it is personnel files from the property management company. Since Wilmington is not their guy, they must check out the 139 employees with access to the master keys. They asks him to join them, but he declines. Beck informs Stabler Warner told her she cannot get DNA from Elizabeth because her body was already released to family and they had her cremated. When he looks at the board, Beck asks what he sees. He tells her the victim pool is dwindling so he will have to go on the hunt again if he has not already. One victim is dead, one moved, and one pregnant. They check the information on Gina and find if he is going to rape her again he has to do so within the next few days.Beck and Stabler catch Cragen on the street. He does not believe the perp will strike Gina since the property management groups knows what they are doing. Stabler tells him he has no other choice it is a compulsion. Beck reminds him everyone knows they are still sorting through over a hundred suspects and that will take time. Stabler adds they do not know they have figured out the time line. Cragen asks how they want to work it. Beck tells him they want to put Gina in a safe house and send in a decoy. Cragen tells them to set it up.Stabler tells Gina they have plain clothes officers doing a sweep. He reassures her safety telling her she will be at a safe house and she will be protected until she takes her life back. He warns her they cannot guarantee they will catch him. When Gina tells them she has every right to be afraid because he has raped her three times, Beck reminds her they are trying to stop him from doing it again. She tells Gina she cannot stay in the apartment for the rest of her life. She needs to get pissed off and take back her life. When Gina goes to pack a few things, Stabler tells Beck she is not qualified to be her counselor and she does not belong in this unit. Beck tells him the victims do not need his shoulder to cry on, but they need information.  Once raped a woman is seven times more likely to be raped again. When he thinks she is blaming the victim, she defends herself saying women need to be better prepared. They need to be aware of their surroundings, watch where they park their car, and look at any guy's approach with caution and suspicion. While Stabler believes that is fear, Beck believes it is survival.At home base, Cragen introduces Patrol Officer Randa Lewis to Stabler and Beck. She looks enough like Gina to pass for her at a distance. Cragen tells her to run a few errands, show her face around the block, then stay in the apartment. Stabler tells her Beck will have her back outside and every room is wired. Cragen asks if she has any questions before Beck and Lewis leave.In the squad room, Munch tells Tutuola he wants to be known as the intrepid Detective Munch. Tutuola accepts Luke Dixon's file Munch hands him and asks about him. Munch tells him the office manager has a degree in microbiology from Columbia so he called his former employer, a biomedical firm, and found out he was fired for sexual misconduct with the promise of bad references to future employers. Tutuola believes since Dixon cannot get a job in his field so he rapes women to get even. Munch tells him they have enough probable cause for a warrant. Tutuola suggests they call Cragen to let him know about the suspect.As Officer Lewis heads in the apartment building, a jogger wearing a hooded jacket stops briefly before passing. After making sure the next officer has her, Beck goes back out to look for the jogger. After getting off the phone, Cragen tells Stabler a picture is on its way of the suspect and office manager Luke Dixon.    While searching Dixon's apartment, Munch and Tutuola find 50 boxes of ovulation kits. After they notice the sofa is not against the wall, they find a hidden door. When they open it, they reveal a chart with the initials of victims, ovulation dates, and rape dates.Beck checks an alley for Dixon. As she looks around, she sees him discard his jacket in a trash can by the road. She runs to him identifying herself as a police officer. He swings at her with a knife. While she is against the building struggling to get Dixon and his knife off of her, Stabler calls requesting her location. When there is no response, he and Cragen run to find her. Beck finally gets him off of her and knocks the knife to the ground. She keeps hitting and kicking him until Stabler pulls her off and Cragen cuffs Dixon. Beck tells Stabler where the knife is before telling him she was going to kill Dixon. Novak yells at Beck about fighting Dixon. Beck tries to tell her he had a weapon leaving her no choice. Novak informs her Dixon is claiming self-defense and she never identified herself. When Beck tells her criminals lie, Novak reminds her of what her jacket looks like. Novak warns if IAB thinks Dixon's story has merit then she will not have her in the unit. Before Gina will do the line-up, Novak tells her the trial will give her life back to her. Gina confidently identifies Dixon as her rapist.Stabler and Novak walk into the interrogation room to Dixon's lawyer announcing he will put photos of his client's injuries into his exhibits. When they ask Dixon if he has access to master keys, he clarifies a lot of people do. Stabler interjects saying they do not have ovulation kits and a rape calendar. Dixon claims he is performing an experiment checking the effectiveness of hormone tests. When Stabler tells him his calendars coincides with the victim's statements, he claims it is a coincidence because the women volunteered. When he claims the incident at his former employer's was a misunderstanding stating unattractive women cry wolf, Novak reminds him wolves are predators. Dixon claims the victim's identification of him was a case of mistaken identity. He willingly volunteers a DNA sample.When Beck and Stabler arrive at the courthouse, Novak informs them Gina is not there and she is not answering her phone. Stabler tells her they will check it out. When they arrive at her building, they are told water is leaking from her apartment. When they gain entry, they find Gina in a tub full of red water with her wrist slit. As soon as Beck sees her, she backs away.In Novak's office, Stabler informs her Gina did not leave a note. Novak blames herself saying she pushed her too hard. Beck tries to tell her it is not her fault and reminds her Dixon is a rapist and murderer. Novak says she can try to get Gina's statement in, but they will have to prove Dixon directly caused her suicide. Stabler suggests Megan. When Novak tells him she could not identify Dixon as her rapist, he tells her Dixon's calendar proves Megan lied because he is the father of her baby. Novak informs him the only way they can compel a sample of amniotic fluid is to charge her with obstruction and perjury. Beck tells her they have to because there are other victims out there and they cannot let him walk.Novak and Stabler meet with the Carlisles and their attorney, Lorna Scarry. Megan confirms she has to be positive before identifying her rapist. Stabler reminds her she was raped on May 21st and asks if she was raped again on June 17th. Novak shows her a copy of the chart in Dixon's apartment. She tells her the dates June 17th and July 11th are beside her initials. Scarry claims the initials belong to someone else since Megan cannot identify her attacker. When Novak suggests Megan is obstructing justice because her rapist impregnated her, Mr. Carlisle claims his wife would not allow her rapist's child to grow inside her body. Novak asks for a sample for testing. When Megan does not cooperate, Novak shows Scarry an arrest warrant for obstruction while Stabler places Megan under arrest. When Mr. Carlisle grabs Stabler's arm to stop him, Stabler warns him not to make matters worse causing him to release his arm. Scarry tells Mr. Carlisle they will make bail and fight this before telling Novak she is making a big mistake.Novak tells Judge Taten Megan has wanted a baby so badly she will perjurer herself to have this child. When Scarry tells her the people insist her client was raped more than once. Novak tells Taten she wants to compel an amniocentesis to establish paternity. Between the calendar saying she was raped twice and an obstetrics expert, they will prove the rapist is the father. Scarry cites Megan's difficulty getting pregnant increases the likelihood this test will harm the baby. Judge Taten tells Novak she will have to wait because the health and welfare of mother and child takes precedence.Beck catches Megan as she leaves her home. Beck informs her another victim is dead. She explains she knows she was raped twice and when he came back the third time she begged for her baby's life causing him to stop. Beck tells her if she will let them do the test, they will go away. When Megan tells her she does not know the baby is his, Beck tells her to find out explaining whether they find out now or in six months they will know who the baby's father is. Megan tells her they will be long gone by then causing Beck to tell her that her rapist will go free.Mr. Carlisle comes down the corridor of the hospital asking Beck where his wife is. She informs him she is in an exam room. After the nurse hands Beck the sample, Megan tells her husband she had to. He tells her as long as he did not know they would have been alright. He leaves his wife standing there to ask Beck if she is satisfied.Novak informs Dixon and his lawyer they have his pubic hair from Elizabeth and his DNA from the amniotic fluid of a pregnant victim. He acknowledges Megan is the pregnant one and asks the sex of the baby. When she tells him he will never know, he threatens to sue for his parental rights. She tells him to keep talking because that will prove Rape One. Dixon tells her birth defects, genetic disease, and mediocrity have become normal. It has to stop. You put the right genes into the right womb, nurtured by the right people. Novak offers 15 to 25 for each count if he provides the names of the other victims on his calendar.Mr. Carlisle comes to the squad room at Stabler's request. He shows him the pictures of Dixon's other victims saying that is why his wife came forward. There will not be a trial so none of it will be on the public record so he can move on with his life. When Carlisle tells him it is not that simple, Stabler tells him it can be done if he wants it. He warns if he makes his wife give up the baby, she will resent him for the rest of his life. Carlisle asks if he could raise a rapist's child. When Stabler tells him to go talk to his wife, he asks what is there to say before leaving. Stabler tells Beck that Carlisle is not ready to deal with it and may never be ready. Beck tells him Carlisle cannot move forward until he does. She asks Stabler to take a ride with her.When Tracy Monroe asks who the bull is, Stabler tells him he is there for his protection before he introduces himself. Monroe introduces himself to Beck and admits to killing her husband. Beck asks if he is admitting guilt so she will not protest his release on parole. He denies that as his reason. She explains she knows everything about him, but she realizes if she fixates on him, she will disappear. She tells him her husband loved her with everything he had and he would be mad if she did that to herself so she has to let it go and forgive him somehow. She shows him pictures of the life he took so he would know how much that life meant to everyone who knew him."

Stabler is on the stand when the defense attorney wants to know if his client ever showed his face during the video of the rape. Stabler says no. The defense attorney then wants to know how the rapist was identified. Stabler tells him by DNA- however it was not DNA from seamen (the rapist had a bit of a problem in that area). Elliot tells the court that he was identified by gum that he spit out on the scene. The defense attorney wants to know who found the gum- Elliot tells the court it was Olivia. The defense attorney then alleges that Olivia planted the gum as a form of revenge which is objected by Casey and Elliot says it's a load of crap. He is dismissed and the defense attorney calls Olivia as a witness. The judge orders them to chambers.Oregon: Liv is still undercover with the eco group that she infiltrated. They show the group standing in a state park protesting a lumber company. The sheriff shows up and orders them to break it up, however they don't. The deputies then proceed to forcefully break up the group. T-Bone (a member of the group) punches a deputy and the deputy starts beating him with his night stick. Liv goes in to break it up however the deputy strikes her on the head- knocking her unconscious. New York: In chambers Casey is outraged and says that the defense attorney has obviously found out the Liv is unavailable and is trying to twist the case- not to mention it isn't his turn to call witnesses. The defense attorney says that he has been trying to  serve her for a month and it's as if she has disappeared into thin air. The judge wants to know exactly where Olivia is and Casey says that shes been under with the feds for five weeks- possibly out of state.Oregon: Olivia is asleep in a hospital bed mumbling Elliot's name. One of her friends in the eco group is in the bed beside her wanting to know who Elliot is. Olivia attempts to change the subject by asking where they are. She finds out that they are in the prison ward of the hospital. Hope – her friend – says that she and T-Bone should sue for abuse. Olivia starts talking like a cop and Hope goes off about her defending the deputy. Olivia agrees saying it must be the concussion talking. Hope then asks again who Elliot is and Olivia says no one, to which Hope says it does not sound that way and then mimics her.New York: Casey storms into SVU wanting to know where Stabler is because she needs to find Liv. Cragen tells her to forget about it because Stabler doesn't know. She then asks Cragen if he knows where she is and he says no- to which Much throws in a witty comment. Casey keeps on about finding her and Cragen just keeps saying no.Oregon: Olivia and Hope are still in the hospital. The doctor is telling her she's fine when another deputy comes into arrest her for assault on an officer. Olivia keeps trying to say she didn't do anything and the deputy just reads her her rights. In the sheriffs office the deputy who struck her takes her down to booking and makes smart remarks because she isn't smiling in her booking photo. Olivia gets mad and starts yelling at him that she didn't do anything. He attempts to take her into an interrogation room to which she replies she wants a lawyer and isn't going into some good ole' boy backroom alone with him. Olivia makes bail and is on her way out of the building when the sheriff asks her to come back in to discuss the murder of a man who works for a pharmaceutical company that the group was recently protesting. He tells her that if she can shed some light on the murder than he will think about dropping the assault charges against her. She looks at a photo and says it's a sex crime and walks out the door.New York: Casey is at the FBI building yelling at an agent who stonewalls her about Olivia. He tells her that Starr isn't her case agent and sends her on her way.Oregon: Olivia is meeting with her case agent- Agent Porter- in a restaurant going over the murder. The case agent says if Edg (an eco-terrorist group) is involved then they could get the entire group on RICO charges. Olivia says that her group isn't involved. The case agent tells her to look into the murder from her group and if the group isn't involved then to let the locals handle it and go back to looking for eco-terrorists. Olivia is next seen in a phone booth where it is revealed that she is talking to Finn in New York. She tells him not to mention it because her case agent will go nuts. Finn wants to know if Casey got a hold of her and then hands the phone over to Stabler for him to explain the problem and Olivia hangs up. T-Bone and Hope are shown walking up wanting to know who she was talking to. Hope makes the comment that it was probably Elliot and Olivia says no that it was her lousy public defender- she wanted to know how much to help with the murder.Olivia then goes to the pharmaceutical company and asks questions about the murder victim. She then goes to visit the victims mother- where she runs back into the deputy that had her arrested. They exchange words. Next she is shown outside the victims house where she notices the tape has been cut and someone is there. It is the victims ex-wife who is trying to take evidence (movies and teen clothes catalogs) out of the house. Olivia figures out that the guy was a pedophile.The next day she is once again meeting with Agent Porter. She tries to tell him the victim is a pedophile; he wants to know if someone in the group told her that, and she admits that she got it from the ex-wife. Porter then accuses the group again to which Olivia adamantly defends the group. He pulls out a stack of papers and and tells her to read page six. It's an email from an untraceable account that was sent to the pharmaceutical company and shows. In the email it has all of the workers home addresses. Porter wants to know if she knew about it and she says no to which he replies I guess you don't know your group all that well then.New York: Casey and the rape victim – Chelsea – are in Casey's office talking about Olivia. Chelsea is obviously upset about the whole ordeal. Casey asks her if she saw the rape crisis counselor and Chelsea says no that she doesn't want to keep talking about it – she will be fine once the guy is convicted. Casey asks her what she will do if the guy walks to which Chelsea replies I guess I will kill myself. Casey calls Huang to talk to the victim and asks him find Olivia. He says he doesn't have much clout with the eco dept. because he is the sex crimes guy and they don't really have a need to work together. Casey replies then what the hell do they have Liv for?Oregon: Olivia shows up at a house that the ex-wife is about to show. She wants to know how many girls the guy has raped. The ex-wife begs her to leave it alone and Olivia figures out the the wife left because she caught him in the act. She tells Olivia about the babysitter.Olivia then goes to the babysitter and gets info that there is a hidden room in the guys garage. It is there that he took his victims. Olivia goes back to the victim's house and finds the room. She calls someone and tells them that she has something they need to see. It turns out she called the sheriff. He thanks her for the lead and tells her to stop playing policewoman and leave. Olivia is next seen a press conference that is jointly held by Agent Porter and the sheriff. They are telling the press about the room and a new discovery: a girl who went missing several years back prints were found in the room. The deputy who arrested her then shows up next to her and tells her they get to go back to the station. The sheriff walks into the interrogation room and tells her that it wasn't his doing- the feds asked him to. Olivia tries to play it off by asking what do the feds want with her to which Porter walks in the room and replies nothing. He then says, ""Det. Benson you are free to go."" Olivia gets upset about him outing her and he gives her a plane ticket to NY. They are walking out and she tells Porter to let her see this case through since she is the one who broke it. He tells her no thanks (hes tired of working with her). She keeps on saying that she has experoence with victims.NY: Back at SVU, Casey is going insane about finding Olivia. Huang walks in and says that he doesn't know. Stabler wants to know if the feds would know if shes all right- to which Huang replies yes, but they might not tell. Casey, obviously upset says I am sure she is fine, but my case isn't. Huang won't divulge who would know where she is to Stabler and Stabler gets upset saying he just wants to make sure she is okay. Huang says he gave a message to his superior who was passing it along. Stabler tells Casey that if Olivia new about the case then she would be there.Oregon: Olivia got Agent Porter to allow her to go with him. In the car, he wants to know if her partner in NY finds her annoying. She tells him that he (Stabler) is her best friend. He (her case agent) says yeah, but does he find you annoying to which Olivia rolls her eyes and says no. She then figures out that the girl is hiding at a childhood fort. They find the girl and get her back to the FBI building. The girl is extremely upset and won't let anyone look at her. Olivia then sends Porter out of the room because he is just making things worse. The girl explains- after much prodding and reassuring- that she loved her captor and that the reason she killed him was not to escape but because he told her she was too old and was making her go find another victim. She then breaks down about how she was only ten. Porter and Olivia talk about how the girl has Stockholm Syndrome while they watch her hugging her parents. Porter then reveals that he got a message from Huang a few days ago and Olivia's face drops.NY: Olivia is seen walking into court where Casey was thrilled to see her. Olivia asks how Chelsea is doing and Casey tells her she will be fine now. The show ends with Chelsea seeing Olivia and saying I thought you weren't going to come to which Olivia says there was never a chance of that happening.**During the time that Olivia was undercover she was known as Persephone James."

As two boys make planes for the rest of the evening, one decides to relieve himself so he climbs onto the rail. He sees the body of Chantal floating in the water when he looks down and alerts his friend. Warner informs Stabler and Beck the 14-year-old victim died from blunt force trauma at least two weeks prior. Stabler notes she could have been dumped anywhere. Warner tells them she is the third rape-homicide victim in the previous six months with a paw print tattoo on her lower back. Sandra Garner, 16-year-old runaway from Wichita, Kansas, was found in the Bronx. The other victim was found in Brooklyn, but has not been identified. They were both severely brutalized so the perp's knuckles should be damaged.Stabler guesses the tattoo could be linked to a gang or cult, but Tutuola tells him there is not a gang using a paw print tattoo. Munch considers it to be because they were fans of Snoopy or future students of Yale. Tutuola suggests they have a good tattoo artist to look at it and see if they recognize the work. Beck mentions she knows one named Miguel Alvarez causing Tutuola and Stabler to figure out she has a tattoo. Stabler offers to show her his tattoo if she will show him hers. She claims it would not be a fair trade.After Beck and Stabler show Alvarez a picture of the tattoo, he tells them it is generic so it could be anyone. Stabler inquires about the enforcement of a sign saying ""No Minors Allowed."" Alvarez assures them he not only checks the identification, but also copies it so he can keep his license. He informs them Lenny Culp, in Brooklyn, will work on minors because he does not have a license and cannot get one due to his prison record.Beck and Stabler announce themselves as they make their way into Culp's establishment. They interrupt Culp as he tattoos a teenager. After looking at the note the teen brought from home, Stabler informs them his son could forge his signature better at the age of eight. They tell the teen to leave without allowing Culp to finish the tattoo. Culp hesitates when they ask about the paw print tattoo, but opens up when Stabler reminds him they caught him in the act of committing a felony and a parole violation. He claims he was told the girls were college cheerleaders. He shows them a pictures of the victims showing off their tattoos together. Beck points out the writing on Chantal's shirt identifying her school as Saint Ambrose. Chantal's foster mother tells Beck and Stabler that she willingly paid Catholic school tuition because she believed Chantal deserved the best in life. Before she was able to tryout for cheerleading like she wanted, Chantal was returned to her crack addicted biological mother after six years of living with her foster mother. She wanted to adopt Chantal, but was told the mother's rights outweighed Chantal's need to be safe. She suspects her mother wanted her back for the welfare check.Beck and Stabler walk with Chantal's mother and three siblings. She informs them Chantal claimed her boyfriend touched her so ACS told her to kick him out. She did not believe Chantal so she told ACS to take her instead. While she is talking, her scooter riding son rides towards traffic being stopped by Stabler just before being hit by a car. The mother acts as if nothing happened before continuing to say Chantal was placed in a group home called Broder House. As they walk away, Stabler tells Beck he knows she wants to hit her. When Beck asks if he does, he looks back at her before saying she is not worth it. He makes sure Beck knows their goal is to find Chantal's killer and put him away.At Broder House, Beck and Stabler are told Chantal left soon after she arrived like hundreds of others. A police report was filed and a letter was sent to her mother. Most of the girls run away to be with their boyfriends, but they will have to ask some of the girls if Chantal ran for that reason. The girls tell them Chantal spent most of her time with Victor. He drives an SUV and buys her junk food. He wanted her to live with him. Chantal left to work for Victor as a prostitute.Stabler arrives into the squad room to Beck looking at the board. When he tells her to go home, she reminds him they already have three dead girls and the fourth one could be picked out by morning. He asks if she knows where to start looking or if she has called Vice. When he fails to receive an answer, he informs her he called Vice and was told the girls work in East New York and they have set up a sting for the following night. He tells her she cannot get over-involved in the cases or each one of them will break her heart. She asks that he move the sting up. While Beck and Stabler sit in the van watching at the track, a girl appearing to be around thirteen uses the van window as a mirror. He comments she is the same age as his youngest daughter. Beck asks how he can stand watching the scene when he knows what will happen once the girls get into a car. After he tells her to sit tight, she bolts out of the van forcing Stabler to tell the other officers to move in. As some take care of the men in the vehicles, the others gather the girls against the wall behind them. Beck and Stabler show them pictures of the victims asking if any of them know the girls, but come up empty. Beck tells them to face the wall so she can check for the tattoo. She calls for Stabler when she finds one. The girls identifies herself as Belinda ""Passion"" Holt. She denies knowing the girls until she is informed they are dead. She tells them they are not dead. They were adopted.Stabler joins Beck in the interview room while she tries to convince Belinda the girls in the picture are dead. When she tries to prove it by showing her the autopsy photos, Belinda tells them she wants to talk to her boyfriend Victor. After Beck clarifies Victor is her pimp, she tells them she and Victor plan on getting married as soon as she is old enough. She identifies the girls in the photo for them. She explains Victor changed Sandra's name to Amber before confirming Chantal's identity. After she identifies the third one as Monique, she explains they are sisters. She informs them the girls were adopted by a rich guy that comes to the tracks looking for nice girls to live with him. She dated him, but was not good enough for him. After Beck gives her the jacket she is wearing, Belinda tells them Blake is an old, white guy that is kind of cute. He drives a black Benz SUV and lives on Fifth Avenue.Fin informs the team 19 white guys own black Mercedes SUVs, but only four live on Fifth Avenue. Munch adds only one of them has a habit of beating women. Blake Peters. Peters is managing partner at a law firm. His ex-wife filed a bunch of domestic violence reports. Stabler notices the cases were dismissed and Peters was sent to an anger management course. When Beck and Stabler arrive at Wallis Inn, they are told Peters checked in two hours prior with his very young wife. To help them gain entry to his room, they threaten to lock the place down for being a public nuisance for prostitution. As Stabler knocks on the door, Beck tells the guy what to say. When Peters opens the door, Stabler cuffs him while Beck informs him he is under arrest for Statutory Rape. As she begins reading him his rights, she watches Candy frantically trying to get dressed.As Beck escorts Candy into the squad room, Candy swears she is over 18 so Beck asks for her identification. Candy dumps her purse onto Beck's desk making it easier to locate and hands it to her. Beck finds she is 19 so she asks how long she has been working the streets. Candy denies this saying she attends Manhattan Tech with the help of her parents. She explains she works at the restaurant where she met Peters that night and was in the mood to party so she ignored his wedding ring. Beck tells her he killed three girls.In the interrogation room, Peters denies killing the girls before explaining his damaged knuckles as injuries incurred while working on his '72 Ferrari Daytona Spyder. Stabler believes his lack of willingness to allow someone to touch the car may be an attitude he shares about the girls. While Peters admits to having sex with them, he denies killing them. When Stabler describes how he believes Peters killed them, Peters rushes to the corner of the room and pukes before denying killing them again. He tells Stabler he wanted to help the girls to get out of this way of life."

After Marc is told he is suppose to be singing as well, Eden tells Frank Hovis she is tired but is told to keep singing. He takes his eyes off the road long enough for the van to swerve in front of an oncoming vehicle. Alma Cordoza warns him and in an effort to correct the move he sends the van off the bridge into the river.When Stabler arrives on the scene, Munch tells him the van tried to take a shortcut to Brooklyn but the river got in the way. Munch shows him the marks on Eden's wrist when he questions the reason for having the case. Stabler introduces himself and asks who did it to her, but gets no response. Munch tells him she and Marc refuse to talk. Tutuola calls them over to the van after it is brought out of the water to show them the handcuffs. He believes the driver freed the children before escaping. O'Halloran informs them there were two adults. One male who is missing his hair piece. One female who is missing a shoe. They realize they need the children to talk. When they turn around, they find Beck holding Eden.Tutuola informs Cragen Eden will only talk to Beck, but has only identified herself and Marc. He continues stating the van is registered to Frank Hovis of Albany. Hovis is single with no kids and has been arrested for assault. Munch shows them a picture of the van going through the Lincoln Tunnel proving a woman was in the passenger seat. Cragen wants the picture released to the media claiming possible injuries from an accident. After being told Stabler and Beck are interviewing the children, Cragen tells them to get the picture to them to help with the interviews. Eden identifies the woman as Alma, but she does not know Hovis or Marc. She does not know where her sister Rosemary is. Beck denies her request to live with her. Eden claims she does not know where Alma was taking her.Stabler informs Cragen that Marc is not talking and he cannot guarantee he speaks English. Cragen tells him to let Huang try. He asks Stabler's opinion of Beck before asking if he wants Benson back. Stabler reminds him his partner is not his choice. As Stabler walks away, he asks if Munch and Tutuola have anything. Cragen tells him they went to Hovis's mother's house in Queens.Mrs. Hovis claims she only hears of her son when the police are looking for him. When Munch asks to look around, she denies him saying she is a respectable woman who lives alone and does not want her neighbors talking. Tutuola approaches them saying he found items on her clothesline that may belong to him. She claims she does not know where they came from. When Munch claims he hears someone inside, Tutuola promises to protect her as they make their way inside the residence despite her protests. Upon looking around, they decide to open bi-fold doors to reveal Hovis. When Mrs. Hovis tries to keep up the charade, Hovis tells her to stop. Hovis tells them he risked his life to save the kids. Alma claimed if she did not cuff them they would try to jump out. Alma got out fine and left without worrying about the kids. He rents out his van and was hired to drive them from Albany to Brooklyn. Alma did not give him an exact location because she was not very trusting. When Hovis is put in the holding cell, he asks Tutuola if he will get his van back. He explains it is evidence before returning his hair piece and walking away. He informs Cragen Alma's last name is Cordoza. Munch explains Hovis picked them up on a street corner in Albany. When Cragen asks if they have more information on the kids, Beck informs him Albany school district does not have any girls Eden's age with her name and all the boys Marc's age and race are where they need to be. Beck questions if it could be the result of child porn or prostitution guessing Eden may be too traumatized to talk. Beck tells Cragen that Stabler is with Huang talking to Marc. He orders them to keep digging until they find Alma. When Beck joins him to watch Marc's interview, Cragen reminds her he meant for her to help them. She claims she may get a lead from the interview.When Cragen and beck join Stabler as he watches the interview, he informs them Marc has not talked or made eye contact. Beck wonders what Alma did to Marc. Before leaving, Cragen tells them to let him know if Marc talks.In an effort to get Marc to talk, Huang draws a house and asks Marc to draw the people he lives with or his pets. Marc scribbles hastily over the house. When Huang tries to find out why he is angry, Marc tells him to shut up and lunges at him causing Beck and Stabler to rush in to help. Stabler pulls Marc off of him while Beck helps Huang off the floor. As Marc fights Stabler talking in French, Beck tries to calm him by speaking in French. Marc escapes Stabler's hold long enough to grab the pen from the table. He stabs Stabler in the right side of his chest. While Huang tends to Marc, Beck pulls the pen from Stabler's chest after asking if he is going to faint on her.In Cragen's office, Huang uses first aid to tend to Stabler's wound. He guesses Marc may be suffering from Reactive Attachment Disorder. He explains kids who are deprived of love and affection grow up to be unable to interact with others. Some kids withdraw like Marc while others become indiscriminately affectionate like Eden. Often kids from foreign countries suffer from the disorder and their adoptive families do not know until the kids are living with them. Stabler, Beck, and Cragen deduce Eden and Marc were in the van to be returned to their adopting agency. When Beck questions where the kids will go now, Stabler tells her it is not their job any more. She reminds him it will be when someone else hurts them causing Cragen to remind her they have not found Alma. Munch and Tutuola join them. Munch explains he found the cab driver who picked up Alma at 4AM and drove her to 152 Staines Avenue in Brooklyn. Cragen orders Stabler to the ER and everyone else to Brooklyn.Tutuola knocks on the door announcing who they are. When he fails to receive a response, Munch thinks the driver may have given them the wrong address while Tutuola looks into a boarded up window with a stick figure drawn on it. As he returns to the door, Munch questions where Beck is. Tutuola rams his shoulder into the door gaining entrance. During their search, Munch finds fresh milk in the refrigerator causing him to deduce they left recently and in a hurry. Tutuola finds a teddy bear under one of the twin beds. They wonder where the kids are. In the hall, Beck joins Stabler. He informs her the Gablers were found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and will serve two years at most. Beck tells him Eden was put in restraints to stop her from scratching herself. Stabler tries to remind her it is not her fault. She does not believe she can do this because she fixes things, but she cannot fix Eden. Stabler tells her they do not fix things in their unit. She wanted to fix her and she thought she could. He tells her he keeps doing the job because he has to. She does not understand why since they do not make a difference. He tries to assure her that she can do this. When she asks if he is asking her to stay, he explains she must be there for herself. She tells him bye before walking away as he watches her leave.

A leashed dog makes his appearance barking. At the girl's request, her boyfriend grabs the leash and they allow the dog to lead them along the path. They see a guy walking away and assume he is the owner of the dog. As he runs away, they find a woman in the bushes gasping for breath. The girl tends to the victim as she takes her last breath while her boyfriend calls for help. The teens inform Stabler the victim's last communication was nodding her head in response to being asked if she was raped. They admit to only seeing the guy's back as he ran away. Stabler reminds them they should not be in the park before asking Officer Mahoney to take them home. CSU informs him an ATM card was found identifying the victim as Danielle Masoner. A coffee cup and a receipt from Café Gabrielle was also found. He assumes that to be the victim's last stop since the receipt was stamped 9:18PM. Stabler tells Warner the outcry witness said the victim was raped. Warner informs him there are no fluids. He notes the bruises possibly resulting from defending herself. Warner rules out strangulation as a cause of death. He informs her the witnesses stated she was gasping for breath. Warner notes scratches on her neck and the lack of bruising and cervical damage concluding she did not have a broken neck. Warner runs through a possible scenario when Stabler asks for her take. Woman goes for a walk in the park with her dog. Perp jumps out of the bushes and attacks. She has a coronary. Stabler concludes she was literally scared to death.Wesley Masoner, Danielle's husband, tells Stabler she has been modeling since she was little. Even though she felt safe with the dog, he always went with her unless he was rehearsing. He explains he runs a Radialus Dance Company and serves as artistic director and choreographer. Stabler asks for a recent photo of ""Dani,"" but changes it to ""Danielle"" when Masoner tells him he is the only one to ever call her that. Masoner hands him her portfolio before answering the doorbell to let Glenn and Naomi Cheales in. After they express their condolences, Masoner informs them of Stabler's presence. Naomi tells him she was with Masoner at rehearsal when Stabler notified him of Danielle. Cheales tells him he is just a computer nerd. When Naomi asks what happened, Stabler tells her Warner thinks she may have had a heart attack.Warner tells Stabler there was no coronary damage. She does not know what killed Danielle so she asks about medical problems. Stabler informs her the victim was healthy making him question if she may have been using drugs. Warner denies it and tells him the rape kit was negative so the teens must have interrupted him. Stabler comments he would like to tell Masoner something about what killed his wife. Warner promises to keep looking before asking if he is working the case alone. He explains Beck went back to Warrants adding they have run out of partners for him. Before he walks out, he returns asking if it could have been an allergic reaction to something she ate. Warner reminds him she was a model before informing him coffee was the only thing in her system.At the coffee shop, a Barista shows Stabler the security video from the previous night. She tells him Danielle comes in alone, but frequently bought a homeless guy coffee. After he notes how closely the guy watches Danielle, he is told the guy may have had a crush on her.Cragen interrupts Stabler's repeated viewing of the tape to urge him to get some rest. Stabler declines saying he wants to be able to identify the guy when he sees him face-to-face. He plans on looking for the guy at a homeless camp in the tunnel near where the body was found. When Cragen tells him to take someone with him, Stabler asks if he is offering to be his partner. Cragen reminds him he is not his type causing Stabler to remind him the women keep leaving him. Cragen takes the opportunity to tell him Benson is back so he may have another chance with her.As he searches the tunnel in Central Park alone, Stabler spots the guy he is looking for. After introducing himself, he tries to get him to identify himself but fails. When he searches his pockets, he finds a picture of Danielle and shows it to him causing him to elbow Stabler and run. Stabler catches him. After a few swings with a knife, Stabler takes him down on the concrete steps. He forces the knife from his hand. After a few solid blows, Stabler stops hitting him.At the hospital, the homeless man is identified as Keener. He has Broca's aphasia, a speech disorder caused by a stroke. Even though his cognitive function and memory are normal, he cannot form words. Stabler is informed Keener has been treated at this hospital for two years. In that time, he has lost everything. The doctor believes that after living on the street for that long, Keener sees everything as threatening, explaining the reason for his attack of Stabler. When the doctor tells him he can talk to Keener now that the Haldol has calmed him, Stabler wonders how he can if he cannot talk.With the use of a dry erase board, Keener draws a description of a 6 foot tall white man he saw with Danielle. When asking about the color of the man's hair, Benson walks in and asks if it was the color of her hair. Stabler asks if she is there to give him a hand. She explains Cragen sent her to be his handler after his fight with Keener. Stabler defends himself saying he had a knife before they resume their questioning. After noticing Keener acting as though he is shaking salt, Benson realizes the man's hair is salt-and-pepper. Keener continues by trying to draw the man's broken arm. When he gets frustrated when they do not figure it out, he grabs Benson's arm and starts to twist it. Stabler tries to stop him, but Benson backs Stabler off telling him they are getting somewhere. Once they understand what he is trying to tell them, he dumps the markers out of the coffee cup. They realize he is telling them the man with the broken arm was seen at the coffee shop.At Café Gabrielle, Benson breaks the awkward silence by asking Beck's reason for leaving. Stabler explains she could not handle the victims, but she did not have to handle him. When he asks how she liked working alone, she tells him she did not. Benson notices their guy walk in so they join him at the counter. She asks how he broke his arm, but is told it is none of her business. As Stabler shows him his badge, Benson tells him it is her business.In the interrogation room, Steve tells Stabler and Benson that Danielle was his friend. He was living with the Masoners after he broke up with his boyfriend until a few weeks prior. He claims he met Danielle for coffee and she had an unpredictable seizure. When he claims he dialed 911, Stabler grabs his arm forcing him to sit down explaining there was only one call for help that night. He asks Stabler why he has to be so rough. He bluntly tells him he still has one arm he can break. Benson tells Stave that Stabler has an anger management problem that she mistakenly thought he had under control. Stabler informs them he has had a rough couple of weeks. Benson assures him Stabler will break his arm. Steve claims he left Danielle once he saw the teens believing they would call for help because he had recreational drugs in his system. He tells them Masoner tossed him down the stairs when he caught him having phone sex with someone. Masoner threatened him and told the person on the other end of the line that he would be a free man soon.Benson and Stabler arrive at the Radialus Dance Company to Masoner yelling at his dancers. Stabler gets his attention, but is told to wait until their break. He responds by telling Masoner to come now and it will take longer than five minutes. Benson tells him he has room on his dance card for her as she grabs his arm and helps Stabler guide him out.In the interrogation room, Masoner denies cheating on Danielle. He claims Steve is a pathological liar. They remind him Steve is the one with the broken arm that he gave him when he caught Masoner cheating. He claims he caught Steve doing lines of cocaine on his glass coffee table and he tripped down the stairs. Stella Danquiss, his attorney, interrupts them unsurprised by their proceeding with the interrogation without her. Benson assures her they were just consulting with him about his wife's death. Danquiss reminds them they do not know how Danielle died. When Stabler informs her they know she was murdered, she asks if he used tarot cards or called the psychic hotline for the information. She repeats they have nothing and until they do they are to leave Masoner alone to grieve.Stabler tells Cragen that Danquiss knows they do not have any evidence. Cragen tells them they need his mistress before asking for Masoner's alibi. When Benson tells him Masoner was at rehearsal, Cragen tells them to verify that with members of the dance company. Stabler tells them he already met one – Naomi Cheales.Benson and Stabler arrive at the Cheales residence as they are returning home with groceries. Cheales opens the door using keyless entry. Naomi explains her husband invents gadgets as a hobby. While Benson helps Naomi with the groceries, Stabler speaks with her husband. Stabler asks an affair Masoner is supposed to be having. He denies it saying he feels like he will be breaking a guy's code of silence. When Stabler reminds him he would be obstructing justice by lying, Cheales confirms Masoner was having an affair. Meanwhile in the kitchen, Naomi denies Masoner's affair to Benson saying he was a love-struck schoolboy. She claims it was the perfect marriage. Cheales continues telling Stabler Masoner cheated all the time, but this one was the love of his life. The only thing he knows is her name is Jen.As they are leaving, Benson recounts the fact she received a fairy tale while Stabler got an affair. Stabler wonders what ""Dani"" would have thought. When she questions who he is talking about, he tells her the victim. She reminds him her name is ""Danielle,"" but he does not get the distinction. She denies something is bothering her when he asks. After he opens his car door, she shows him the contact information for members of the dance company with only one ""Jen"" sounding name. The stage manager. Geneva Dworkin.At the dance company, Geneva informs them she is not into guys and no one calls her ""Gen."" When she asks Benson her name, she is told ""Detective."" They confirm Masoner was there the night Danielle was killed. He apparently gets action on the side all over the building because there is a new one every season. She believes he is either being more discreet or he is alone this season. Stabler suggests he could be seeing someone outside of the company before answering his ringing cell phone. Geneva tells them Masoner spent the dinner break from 8-9:30PM in his office before Stabler tells Benson Warner has something for them.Warner welcomes Benson back after commenting that Stabler is recycling old partners. She tells them Danielle was poisoned with Dieldrin. It was rubbed into her skin in an area that was covered by a bruise. She informs them Dieldrin is banned in the US. Dieldrin causes violent seizures explaining why the witness thought she was confirming she was raped and why her clothes were ripped. She was poisoned no more than 30 minutes prior to collapsing, which was about the time she got to the coffee shop.While watching the video from Café Gabrielle, they notice she is wiping something from her arm and guess it could be the Dieldrin. She was poisoned just before going into the café. The time frame coincides with the dinner break Masoner had. He could have snuck out, poisoned her, and returned before he was missed. She asks why he did not just get a divorce. Munch interrupts them saying there is no money in divorce before welcoming Benson back by telling her he should have brought cupcakes. He proceeds to tell them he ran Danielle's financials. She was making over seven figures from top fashion magazines, but the dance company cannot make payroll without Danielle giving Masoner $10,000 a month. Her estate is worth much more than that and he gets it all because of her death. Munch muses that his lack of an estate is the reason his ex-wives never followed through on their threats. Stabler reminds him he has his Warren Commission memorabilia. Benson excuses herself to call Novak for a search warrant for the loft.As Benson and Stabler search, Masoner tells them they will not find anything because he would never hurt his wife. Stabler comes from the kitchen with gloves and a vial of Dieldrin. Masoner denies they are his before his front door opens. Naomi comes in apologizing for her tardiness only to stop when she sees the detectives. Benson greets her, but asks if she should call her ""Jen"" instead of Naomi.In the interrogation room, Naomi declares Masoner did not kill Danielle. Benson suggests the affair gives her reason to lie being sure to remind her of her use of the name ""Jen."" Naomi explains Masoner only used the name when he told Cheales about their sex life. She asked him to stop. Benson reminds her she has been lying to them for three days. Naomi clarifies she lied about an affair, not murder. Benson believes the two are related. When Naomi tells her she was with Masoner in his office when Danielle was killed, Benson suggests they killed her together.In another interrogation room with Danquiss present, Masoner denies he or Naomi committed murder. Stabler and Novak tell them the vial of Dieldrin found under his sink and him telling Naomi he would be a free man soon guides them from adultery to murder. After telling Masoner to be quiet, Danquiss asks them to step outside.Danquiss tells Novak and Stabler they have the dots, but they cannot connect them. When Stabler claims the vial connects them, she reminds them it is circumstantial. Novak will take that kind of circumstantial evidence over three eyewitnesses any day. Danquiss suggests Stabler could have planted the vial before claiming it could have been left there by the previous tenants. Danquiss tells Stabler that juries believe her fairy tales as if she were Tinkerbell before confirming they did not find Masoner's fingerprints on the vial or at the crime scene. She reiterates the fact he was with his mistress and they cannot prove otherwise. When Benson joins them, Danquiss leaves to allow them to further dismantle our criminal justice system. Stabler comments to Novak and Benson the temperature in the room goes up five degrees just from Danquiss leaving the room. Benson reports Naomi swears she was with Masoner and warns it will be tough to break the alibi. Novak recounts Warner saying Dieldrin is banned in the US causing her to wonder if Masoner has been to Europe recently. Stabler reminds her he would not have to have been there to purchase something from there. Benson comments she likes to see her tax dollars at work as they go to find out if the Feds have a record of it.At the Department of Homeland Security, Agent Hellerman tells Benson and Stabler they keep tabs on illegal chemical sales around the world because they are cheap and dangerous making them good weapons. He tells them Dieldrin is a pesticide that killed some endangered species and farmers causing it to be banned since 1987. He believes it is hard to get since it is out of production, but can be obtained on the Asian black market or on the internet. They have found it in Jakarta, Bangkok, and Kanagawa, Japan. When Benson asks if he will check for sales to Masoner, he agrees to do anything for her. He locates the sale of one vial from Kanagawa to Masoner and agrees to print the shipping receipt as Stabler's phone announces a call from Kathy. After she thanks Hellerman, he attempts to ask her out but is told to stick to hunting down terrorists before she joins Stabler. He tells her Dickie was suspended for busting a kid's lip open. When she comments on his fatherly pride and her approval of his talking to Kathy, he asks for the receipt.In the interrogation room, Benson shows Masoner the receipt and informs him he became the owner of a two gram vial of Dieldrin three weeks prior. When he denies it, Benson reminds him his credit card was used and Stabler reminds him the shipment had to be signed for. Masoner claims his credit card was stolen and someone forged his signature. Novak calls it the icing on the cake. When Danquiss tells him to be quiet, Novak agrees saying she does not need a confession with their evidence. Danquiss doubts it.Novak informs Benson and Stabler Danquiss will push for Manslaughter Two. Stabler thinks she will use the Twinkie defense while Novak believes she will claim extreme emotional disturbance. When Benson asks if a jury will buy it, Novak tells her they need witnesses to testify to Masoner being a creep. Stabler does not think it will hard to do. When Cheales interrupts them, Novak excuses herself to her office. Cheales thinks he is paranoid after Danielle, but expresses concern over Naomi's failure to return home the night before. Benson is astonished Naomi did not call him. Stabler tells him she is there and he need to talk to her.As they are preparing to listen to Naomi and Cheales talking in the interview room,  Benson compliments Stabler on his decision to let them speak. He explains he figures Naomi is more likely to talk if he confronted her. Cheales asks Naomi how she could do this to him. She explains she felt smothered. She tried to tell him, but he would not listen. When he says he loves her, she corrects him saying he wants to control her and that is not the same thing. He wonders that with the people she is around why she chose him. She tells him she loved him, but he never believed it and pushed her away. She apologizes after he asks if she was going to sleep her way to stardom. She denies sleeping with Masoner in their home before he orders her to shut up saying he does not want to hear it. As he leaves, she asks for him to wait. Benson passes him on her way in and with Stabler behind her she tells Naomi people fall in and out of love all the time. Naomi tells them Masoner said she could dance two leads every season. She feels terrible because she did not want him to find out that way. When Naomi's breathing becomes a struggle, Benson asks if she is okay before she passes out. While Stabler performs CPR, Benson calls for an ambulance.At the hospital, Stabler attempts to hand Benson a soda but is told she does not drink them any more. When he asks if there are any other major changes he should know about, she comments on his change from suits to jeans. He explains it is for comfort before asking if she thinks Naomi was poisoned like Danielle. Benson confirms they had the same symptoms. The doctor interrupts them to let them know Naomi is stable, but she may get worse. She has Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, a genetic condition that slowly eats away at the liver. She collapsed because her blood pressure dropped due to an infection in her shoulder from a unsterile injection. When they are shown what was removed from her shoulder, Stabler identifies it as an RFID chip and believes he knows who put it there. The doctor informs them it must have been implanted when Naomi was unconscious because she denies knowing who put it there. Stabler comments it is a high-tech way of keeping tabs on a cheating wife. Cheales invented a ho-jack. Benson realizes he has known about the affair for a while and believes he could get Dieldrin. Stabler concludes Cheales framed his wife's lover for murder.As Cheales explains the necessity of protecting information to prevent a ""back-orifice"" attack, Stabler guesses that would hurt announcing their presence. Benson notes his lack of surprise at their presence before he asks them not to make a scene. Cheales denies killing Danielle. Benson informs him they are there about Naomi.In the interrogation room, Cheales explains he put the chip in Naomi so that he could keep tabs on her. Stabler reminds him Naomi is a human and not a pet. Cheales defends himself saying she was cheating on him. Benson reminds him he had no right to tag her. Cheales believes that in 15 years everyone will be implanted with the chip. Stabler wants no part of it. Cheales dismisses it as someone not understanding the technology.At the Cheales residence, Morales explains the RFID chip reader was installed in the lock mechanism. Stabler tells him they were told it was for keyless entry. Morales informs him it records coming and going times for anything with a chip installed. Benson adds the possibility of it being implanted. Morales tells them that piece was not the only one. Benson wonders where the others are.At TARU, Morales shows them two other chip readers telling them they were found at the dance company and at Masoner's. They kept a record of whenever Naomi entered a door and Cheales downloaded it to his computer or PDA.Benson plugs Cheales's handheld into the station's system. Cheales uploaded and analyzed Naomi's every move. He knew when she was with Masoner. Munch joins the conversation saying technology makes it easier for people to spy on each other. Stabler reminds him that not everyone is a snoop. Munch asks if he uses spy ware to monitor his kids. Stabler defends himself saying there is no way his kids are going to surf the net without him knowing where they are going. Munch considers it parents acting as Big Brother. Stabler reminds him Cheales is a killer who tracks his wife like cattle. Benson adds they have to link him to Danielle's death.Cheales does not believe they can prove anything. They tell him it is adding up since they have the RFID chip from Naomi. Stabler muses a possible second murder charge. Benson comments techies sing the praises of technology without knowing the costs before cuffing him for a field trip.At Mercy General, Benson and Stabler show Cheales his wife in a hospital bed. Benson explains his RFID chip put her there. Cheales complains they did not tell him she was sick. Benson reminds him she is there because of him. Stabler tells him he needs to learn to sterilize needles if he wants to play with them explaining she has an infection in her bloodstream. When Cheales asks to see her, Benson demands he come clean first. He tries to explain her liver condition, but is told they already know. He agrees to tell them everything if they let him see her to explain  understand why he did it so she will understand.Cheales tells Naomi he drugged her tea one night before bed three weeks prior so he could implant the chip because he thought she was cheating on him. She asks if he feels better knowing. He was afraid he was going to lose her claiming he never loved anyone more. She believes he is obsessed. He killed Danielle to frame Masoner. And now he has killed her, too. He manages to express his love for her before she flat lines. Stabler opens the door to yell for a doctor as Benson steps in to move Cheales out of the way. Cheales begs the medical personnel to save her as they work on her. Benson tells him that as long as Naomi is alive he only faces assault charges, but if he does not start talking he will face double homicide charges because they will not be able to help him. He tells her Masoner took the love of his life so he took his. They move out of the room as the doctor says they need to get Naomi to ICU.As they are following the gurney down the hall, Cheales tells them he followed Danielle. He pretended to run into her and spilled it onto her arm. He put it under Masoner's sink after Stabler showed up. When he asks them to tell him Naomi will be okay, Benson informs him he is under arrest for the murder of Danielle Masoner. As they turn to leave, they see Masoner approaching them. Masoner tells them Cragen informed him they were there. He wanted to thank them for catching the right and to say ""Screw you"" for putting him through hell. Masoner greets Cheales and asks if he tried to kill Naomi as well. When Cheales tells Benson and Stabler to get Masoner out of there, Benson informs him they cannot do that. As she moves him one way and Stabler blocks Masoner from advancing, Cheales gets by her to punch Masoner with his cuffed hands. Masoner fights back causing them to fall to the floor. After a few good punches, Stabler pulls Masoner off of Cheales and orders him to leave.In the squad room, Novak wonders what they were thinking by taking Cheales to see his wife. Benson reminds her she got the confession. Novak suspects it will be thrown out because of coercion. Stabler reminds her they were leaning on a suspect. Even though Novak knows Stabler broke up the fight, she believes he took his time resulting in a beaten up suspect Novak questions if Benson is rusty after being gone so long. Stabler tells her she is out of line causing Novak to wonder what his excuse is. When Benson asks if she is done assassinating their characters, Novak asks if she is finished flushing the case down the toilet. Cragen arrives to inform them Naomi's liver failed and will die in 48 hours if she does not receive a transplant from Cheales. Novak reminds them his confession and arrest took his ability to donate away unless they get a special dispensation from the corrections commissioner.Tom Sablone, Corrections Commissioner, confirms Benson and Stabler want him to release Cheales so a doctor can cut him open before denying their request. Benson reminds him Naomi will die. He tells her the guy responsible is in his custody and is a murderer despite Benson's reminder of it being a hospital. Stabler asks him if he wants to be one because his actions determine whether Naomi lives. Sablone believes he is a flight risk because an inmate in Kentucky escaped under similar circumstances. When he tells them he does not have the money or manpower to guard Cheales, they volunteer to guard him and transport him. He admits he fears future requests if he grants this one. Benson tells him Naomi has 48 hours to live and is innocent. He has the power to save her.Benson informs Cheales she heard his surgery went well. Cheales tells them the doctor told him Naomi has a good chance so he can do his time knowing she is alive. He thanks them then as he is wheeled out of the room, he tells Naomi he loves her. When Benson asks how she is feeling, Naomi tells her she is tired. The roses on the table are from her mother. Masoner has not called. Stabler tells her to take care of herself before attempting to leave. She stops them to have them tell Cheales she said thanks.As they leave, Benson and Stabler agree that ""Love's a bitch."" Benson realizes they have been partners for years and do not know each other's blood type. A positive. When they get in the elevator, Stabler informs her he would give her a kidney. She tells him he will not be able to if she gives him hers first. She smiles and he turns to look at her as the elevator doors close."

Dickie surprises his family by choosing Michael as his instead of Peter. When Maureen asks Stabler about it, he informs her St. Michael is the Patron Saint of Cops. Kathy thinks Dickie is just trying to please his father. Kathleen thinks he is trying to get Stabler and Kathy back together. After the ceremony, Stabler invites them to lunch at P&G's. Kathleen informs him she has been a vegetarian since the previous summer and they are going to their grandmother's. He tells them they will do something special the following Saturday. As Kathleen drags her off, Maureen tells him bye. Kathy reminds him the situation is still hard on the kids. He assures her he understands that. When Father Denis interrupts them to ask Stabler a favor, Stabler tells Kathy to tell the kids he wants to say bye before they leave. After she walks away, Father informs him he has a ministry at Haven House, a hospice. Judson Tierney is a patient there with end stage lung cancer. Father Denis wants Stabler to speak with him as soon as possible since he does not have more than a few days to live. Stabler arrives at the hospice to speak with Tierney. When Stabler introduces himself, Tierney tells him he has been waiting for this day for 30 years and he almost missed him.Tierney tells Stabler a priest used to be able to keep his mouth shut unlike Father Denis. He would let it go with a few Hail Marys, a good Act of Contrition, and do not do it again. When Stabler asks if he wants to confess, he asks if he needs a lawyer. Stabler tells him he can have one if he wants one. Tierney asks what he is charging him with. Trying to get him to talk, Stabler asks if he needs him to tell him causing Tierney to figure out that Stabler does not know. Tierney compliments him before calling him ""flatfoot"". Stabler informs him he is with Special Victims when he asks. Tierney wonders are all victims not special causing Stabler to explain his unit investigates rape, child abuse, kidnapping, and homicide. Stabler tells him he is there if he wants to talk. Tierney tells him not to rush him. Stabler reminds him of his impending death. He informs him his daughter hung up on him when he tried to call her so the doctors called. He has a lot of things to get off his chest. His daughter deserves to hear it from him. He tells Stabler if he will bring his daughter to him, he will tell him everything. When Stabler arrives at the squad room, Benson informs him Judson Tierney's record is clean, but they cannot be sure without fingerprints. He owns a house in Rego Park. He opened a locksmith shop in 1971 where he worked until the previous year when he got sick. He does not have any credit card debt. He has about $18,000 in his checking account. He has a small IRA. No red flags. Benson verified Tierney has never been investigated or a suspect with a friend at Intel. Benson gives him the address for Sheila Tierney DuMont on 83rd telling him she is a married schoolteacher with two children. When she volunteers to go with him to see her, he asks if she thinks Tierney molested his daughter. She responds by telling him Father Denis chose him for a reason. He tells her if Tierney did abuse her the statute of limitations ran out a long time ago. She reminds him it is never too late to help a victim. Sheila tells Benson and Stabler her life is none of their business. Stabler informs her that her father does not have much time left. She invites them back when he dies saying she will open the champagne. Stabler tells her he is trying to clear his conscience. She does not believe that is her problem. She has not seen Tierney since 1989 when her mother died. She was 18. He went her daughters' school and introduced himself on the playground. Sheila told them next time to run to a teacher. When Benson asks if he abused her, she asks them to leave. Stabler gives her his card in case she changes her mind before telling her that her daughters are beautiful. She stops them before they open the door to ask them to take a box she has in the basement to Tierney as a bon voyage present.In the squad room, Benson and Stabler dump a box of greeting cards on a desk. Benson notices they are all from Tierney. Stabler opens one with a message stating ""Sheila, please forgive me."" Enclosed is a $100 bill. Benson opens one and fins the same message with another $100 bill. Stabler guesses there is a card there for every week since the last time he saw his daughter. Benson figures there are thousands of dollars there if they all have money in them.Benson and Stabler attempt to take the cards back to Sheila. She tells them to give the money to charity because there are some things money cannot buy. Benson lists forgiveness as one thing it cannot buy causing Sheila to tell her to give up because she is not going to talk about it. Stabler informs her some of the cards are addressed to her daughters suggesting they may want to read them. She tells them to get them out of her house. Stabler asks why she kept them instead of burning or trashing them. She was saving them for this occasion so he would know she never read any of them. As they leave, Benson tells Stabler she thinks Tierney molested his daughter because she reacted like a victim by cutting off all contact and refusing to allow him to see her daughters. Stabler believes Tierney did something wrong, but doubts he abused her causing Benson to ask why Tierney is under his skin. He denies it. Benson reminds him the cards have Tierney's saliva and fingerprints. If his DNA matches in the system, then they have him. She suggests they drop the cards off at the lab before grabbing dinner. He suggests they eat in the cafeteria of Haven House saying she should meet Tierney. Stabler knocks on Tierney's door before opening it. Tierney asks if he found his daughter. Stabler turns around and tells Benson to come in. Tierney mistakes her for Sheila, but Stabler corrects him introducing her. Tierney tells her she looks like Sheila. Benson explains she is Stabler's partner. When he asks if they think this is a joke, Stabler tells him to tell them if it is. Tierney confirms Sheila refused to come before explaining she is a tough kid. Even her father dying will not soften her up. When he pushes the button to his morphine drip, it does not work. He wants the doctor to just knock him out. Benson asks if he wants to spend his last days in a drug-induced coma. Tierney tells them she sounds like Sheila. Benson takes it as a compliment. She tells him Sheila looks good. When he asks for more details, she tells him she is beautiful and so are Ashley and Lindsay. He does not know where Sheila got the names. He realizes one of them has a birthday coming up so he needs to send her a card causing Benson and Stabler to glance at each other. When Benson asks what he did to Sheila, he tells her he hurt her. Benson asks how before he apologizes to her as if he believes Benson is Sheila and falling asleep. Stabler's pager begins beeping. He tells her it is the lab guessing they finished processing the cards. She tells him to go on and she will stay with Tierney hoping he will wake up willing to talk. At the Crime Lab, O'Halloran tells Stabler he was able to get DNA from the envelope flaps, but it was not a match to anything in the system. He was also able to lift fingerprints from the cards. He ran them and they came back belonging to Jake Tierney. He was arrested in 1956 for Burglary in Peoria. He was also arrested for Attempted Burglary in St. Paul in 1957 and Breaking and Entering in El Paso in 1958. He never did more than 6 months and nothing in 50 years. None of the money is newer than 1970 causing Stabler to deduce Tierney has a stash. As he calls Benson, O'Halloran tells him he checked with the FBI and was able to get a case number. He tells Benson they found something interesting so he is going to the FBI before asking if Tierney is awake.As Benson tells Stabler Tierney is still asleep, Tierney tells her he is awake. Benson returns to her conversation with Stabler telling him to call her if he finds out anything. Tierney asks if Stabler is putting in overtime to try to figure out the case. Benson suggests she know he abused Sheila. He admits he has done some bad things, but denies doing that saying he never laid a hand on her. She asks why he keeps asking Sheila for forgiveness. She wants to know what kind of father would molest his daughter then send her a reminder every year. Tierney tells her he does not know what her father did to her, but she needs professional help. He hopes Stabler has more sense.At the FBI, Agent Peters introduces herself to Stabler before he asks if she is assigned to case number 71210. She informs him cases beginning with 71 are from 1971 so the agent would be retired by now. The case is not closed so she will take a lead if he has one. He informs her that her case may be connected to his case and asks her to tell him about it. She explains two men committed the longest string of bank robberies. They are known as the Fedora bandits and have been on the most wanted list for 47 years. Tierney tells Benson and Stabler you appreciate beautiful mornings more when you do not have many left. He informs them the sky becomes clear before a big storm hits like God is trying to warn us that ""Good things don't last."" Benson thinks it is his guilty conscience talking. Tierney claims it is the morphine. When he says he is cold, Benson gets him a blanket to cover up with. He is impressed when Stabler asks if he wants his fedora, but reminds them he does not have much time to figure it out. When Stabler asks if he is ready to confess to 21 armed robberies, Tierney tells him it is just the beginning. Elliot believes it has to do with 1971, the year Sheila was born. Tierney tells them the first time he held her in his arms, he knew he had to protect her and he could not do that if he was in jail. Benson believes Sheila is mad because she found out what he had done, but Tierney assures her she never knew. He never talked about his business to anyone, even a cop as pretty as Benson. Stabler announces he is done with it and is going to turn it over to the FBI as he walks away. Tierney reminds him it is just the beginning and asks him to trust him. As Tierney starts to roll away, Benson asks where he is going. He explains the drugs are making him tired, but asks her to stay saying she will never know when he will feel like talking. Father Denis approaches Stabler in the squad room asking about Tierney. Stabler informs him Tierney gave up the bank jobs. He is writing up the report for the Feds. When Father Denis asks if that is all he told him, Stabler asks if he is trying to tell him there is more. He asks for his guest to sit down before telling him Tierney is not talking to him. Father Denis reminds him that Tierney has been silent for a long time and old habits are hard to break. Stabler explains he has 12 open cases on his desk that he should be spending time on rather than playing 20 questions with Tierney. When Father Denis tells him his immortal soul is in danger, Stabler tells him eternal damnation is not a police matter. Father Denis responds saying it is not entirely a spiritual matter either. By doing this, he believes Stabler will be saving an entire family. Sheila tells Stabler she did not know about the robberies, but her dad is a pro at hiding things like her whole life. Stabler tells her she is a lot like her father. She hates him for keeping secrets when she has plenty of her own. She explains when her mother died, he wanted her to stay at home and go to college in Queens. She felt she needed to get out of the house. She saved her money wanting to go to Europe. She needed her birth certificate in order to get her passport, but refused to give it to her. She picked the lock on the strongbox containing the family papers. Stabler interrupts her saying she does not hate her father because of a missed summer vacation. She continues saying her birth certificate listed her father as Judson Tierney and her mother as Suzanne Mollinax, but her mother's name was Lenore. He explained it saying that her mother could not have children. He had an affair and had gotten her pregnant. Her parents never hugged her or said they loved her. Stabler explains that was the old school Irish way saying his parents were the same way. She does not believe it is the same thing saying the house was nothing but locked doors and silence. He tells her that does not mean they did not love her. She tells him her father made her mother raise his lover's child. She believes that is why they never touched her. She thinks her mother probably hated her. He doubts that. She reminds him they will never know.Huang reminds Stabler it is Sheila's choice whether to see her father or not. Stabler believes she will regret it if she does not see him before he dies. Stabler reminds him that all shrinks talk about is closure. Huang quotes Tolstoy's Anna Karenina saying ""Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way"" adding that families are complicated. Stabler responds saying, ""Tell me about it."" He asks Huang how to get Tierney to talk. Huang explains he will talk when he is ready and not before causing Stabler to remind him the guy is running out of time and he is running out of patience. Huang tells him he cannot rush Scheherezade of 1,001 Arabian Nights. He explains Scheherezade is the narrator. She made up the stories for a king who would marry a new bride every night and cut off the head of the one from the night before. She told him a story so gripping he could not kill her until he heard the end of it, but the story never ended. Huang believes Tierney is trying to stave off death like Scheherezade. Stabler concludes he is trying to hold on to make peace with his daughter. Huang suggests that since his real daughter will not come to him, then Benson needs to take her place. Stabler tells him she already has explaining she has been glued to his side sitting with him all night as he slept. Huang tells him that is Tierney's fantasy of a daughter. Benson needs to get furious with him. Stabler questions Benson needing to get mad at Tierney. Huang believes if she does, Tierney will do whatever it takes to get her back. Benson wakes Tierney telling him there will be plenty of time to sleep later. She wants him to tell her about Suzanne Mollinax. He tells her Suzanne died a long time ago. When Benson tells him she was Sheila's birth mother, he tells her his wife Lenore was her mother. He explains he told Sheila that blood does not matter, only love matters. Benson questions his version of love when he forced his wife to raise another woman's child. He denies he forced her saying she wanted a child, but could not have any. Benson believes they could have adopted, but is reminded he was a convicted felon. When he claims to have been a good father, Benson asks why Sheila will not talk to him if he was so devoted causing him to get up from the bed to go to the restroom. She tells him he cannot hide from his secrets any more. They are all coming out. He thinks he was just trying to protect her, but Benson does not buy it. She believes he was trying to protect himself so he would not go to prison. She tells him Sheila does not want to hear it and neither does she. When she threatens to leave, he comes out of the restroom asking if she has a car.At St. Paul's Cemetery in Plattsburg, New York, Tierney informs Benson that Lenore was born and raised in Plattsburg and deserved to be buried there. Upon seeing the roses, Benson assumes Sheila has been there, but is told the roses are from him. He used to bring the roses himself, but the florist does it now. When Benson offers to give him a minute, he tells her he does not have to come to the cemetery to talk to her. He tells her she better start digging. At first she thinks he is talking about the grave, but he tells her to look under the flowers. While she locates a set of keys, he informs her he believed Lenore would keep him from being tempted. She asks him what they go to, but he walks away.Stabler tries the key in every lock he can find in Tierney's house and outside. When he kicks something hidden under leaves on the ground, he removes the leaves locating the keyhole. He unlocks it and opens the door to the storm shelter. He looks around and finds a trunk. He opens it and sees it is filled with $100 bills. He calls Benson. As he tells her about the millions of dollars Tierney has stashed there, he opens the other trunk and finds the remains of other half of the Fedora Bandits. In the morgue, Warner informs Stabler the victim he found was shot at close range in the heart. He could have been killed recently or years ago. She explains mummification can occur at different rates depending on the environment the body was kept in. Stabler notes the wide collar and short tie the victim has on are from the 70s. When Warner suggests it brings back memories, Stabler asks if those memories are of her when she was in diapers. She is thankful for the compliment. The coins she found in his pocket are from 1971 so she guesses that will be as close as she will get to a time of death. Stabler tells her it makes sense considering the Fedora Bandits stopped robbing banks at that time.Benson approaches Tierney interrupting his meal suggesting he stopped robbing banks after he killed his partner instead of for Sheila. He admits it is true adding Jack had it coming. While he shows no remorse for it, he regrets stuffing Jack's body in a trunk and letting it rot in his backyard because it smelled bad. He did not turn himself in because there were other people involved. Benson reminds him Jack's family was involved, but is told Jack did not have kids and his wife was better off without him claiming he made sure she was taken care of as Benson helps him put on his oxygen tube when his coughing becomes bad. She asks if his wife would want to know he was dead. Rita Colino announces to her friends gathered around her dining table that she is a widow. One of them congratulates her before asking if she wants to be dealt out of the hand. Rita confirms she does before turning back to Stabler saying she has not thought about him in years. She knows he earned more than what he put on his income taxes explaining he bought her a piece of jewelry every time she got too curious. She hands him a picture before stating she thought he ran off with his mistress. At the time, people did not divorce for any reason, but she considered it when she found out his mistress, Suzanne Mollinax, ended up pregnant. Suzanne asked him to get a divorce, but he never asked. He had affairs, but always came home to her. She only found out about the baby because Suzanne showed up on her doorstep begging her to let him go. When Stabler asks for her name, she tells him it rhymes with ""hunt"" before telling him her given name.Benson shows Tierney the picture of Jack as she tells him he and Jack were both sleeping with Suzanne at the time she became pregnant. He tells her Sheila is Jack's child causing her to ask why his name is on the birth certificate instead of Jack's. He asks her to get him a cigarette explaining exactly where they are located. When she asks if he is joking, he reminds her he is already dying. Tierney explains when Sheila was about a month old, Jack called saying he was out of gas and needed him to bring a can of gas to him at Suzanne's. Jack killed her before he got there after she threatened to turn him in about the bank robberies if he did not leave his wife. Jack believed his problem was solved, but he needed to get rid of the body so he started splashing the gas around. Tierney reminds Jack about the baby, but is told she does not matter. Jack went towards the crib with the gas can in his hand so he shot him and took the baby. He told his wife the truth about the whole thing. After she cried for an hour, she made him promise that part of his life was over. He put the money and Jack in the bomb shelter and never looked back. When Benson asks why he did not tell Sheila she was adopted, he asks what he was supposed to tell her. Her mother was a blackmailing tramp. Her father was a murderous thief and he killed him. Benson realizes he did not want Sheila to hate herself. He tells her he needs to answer for killing Jack and kidnapping Sheila so he wants her to arrest him. She stands up and begins reading him his rights after she informs him of the charges against him.As Stabler enters the squad room, Tutuola asks him if he is trying to make them look bad by solving 21 bank robberies, a murder, and a kidnap in 48 hours. Stabler attributes it to Catholic guilt stating it is a good thing. Munch thought Jews had a corner on that market before questioning why he was not at Federal Plaza gloating. Stabler explains he had to pull up the paperwork on the old cases to write up the charges on Tierney. Tutuola offers his assistance. Stabler tells him he needs the case for the 1971 Arson-Homicide on Suzanne Mollinax. When Munch asks where Benson is, Stabler explains she is guarding Tierney after he insisted on going to Central Booking, but his doctor would not let him. Tutuola shows Stabler that Suzanne's ex-husband, Mike, was convicted in 1972 of two counts of Murder Two and Arson in the first.At Sing Sing Prison, Mike Mollinax informs Stabler that on September 17, 1971, he was at McFadden's when the police arrested him for killing Suzanne and the baby. He denied doing it, but no one believed him because he was a mean drunk. He threatened to burn the house down if he ever caught her with another man after she threw him out. When he heard she was set on fire, he expected to be arrested so he moved in with his girlfriend. They had a fight and he beat her up. The next day, she turned him in. Stabler realizes they were only able to prove motive. Since he was a violent drunk, it only took the jury 20 minutes to convict him. He asks if he is really going to get out of jail.Novak informs Stabler she will get Mollinax out because wrongful convictions make the whole system look bad. She will draft a 440 motion and get it on the calendar within a day or two. Since Tierney will not be able to be at the hearing, she will take a sworn statement from him and have it admitted as his dying declaration with an affidavit from his doctors stating he is unable to be there. Stabler does not believe Tierney knew of Mollinax's conviction.Tierney confirms he did not know Mollinax was convicted claiming he would have said something sooner had he known. Stabler confirms the arrest and trial were not covered in the papers. Novak explains she will swear him in and will take a recorded statement. He tries to speed her up as she gets everything ready for his statement. She presses record and attempts to swear him in, but is interrupted by his coughing and constant pushing on his morphine drip. When she finally gets him sworn, he states his name as Judson Martin Tierney. She begins by informing him she wants to talk about the events of February 10, 1971 at the home of Suzanne Mollinax. He confirms he was there after Jack called him. Jack wanted him to help get rid of the body. Before she can go any further, he falls asleep. Benson informs her the morphine causes him to drift in and out. She informs them that even though the morphine does not effect his memory, it makes his statement inadmissible. Without the statement, she cannot get Mollinax out of jail.The doctor informs Benson, Stabler, and Novak that Tierney is in a lot of pain so she increased his morphine that morning. She hopes he will not wake up. When Novak asks, she tells her Narcan will counteract the morphine. She cannot do that without his consent. Stabler reminds her he will not consent as long as he is doped up. He chose the treatment so she cannot go against his wishes. Benson and Stabler confirm Sheila Tierney can request the Narcan.Sheila confirms Stabler's version of Tierney's story before asking why he did not tell her. Stabler believes he was trying to protect her. She agrees to sign the papers stating she does not want an innocent man paying for her dad's mistakes. She asks Stabler to promise to tell Tierney she did not do it for him.Sheila signs the papers where the doctor tells her. The doctor explains she will administer the Narcan and he will wake up immediately if she wants to see him. The doctor takes Stabler's place in Tierney's room as Stabler takes hers in the hall. He asks Sheila if she wants to see him. When she is unsure, he reminds her Tierney kept the secrets from her because he did not want to hurt her. He justifies this adding he has done the same thing with his children. The doctor informs them he is coming out of it. Sheila goes in, but decides against it running back out. When Tierney sees her, Benson tells him Sheila will be back. He does not believe her, but asks where Novak is so she can finish taking his statement. Benson tells him Novak is ready whenever he is. He reminds her she better make it quick.At Sing Sing Prison, Stabler is told they are 20 years too late. Mollinax was involved in a prison fight in 1985 where he killed someone. The prison is going to file on him for the homicide. Stabler explains to Mollinax that he will be charged for the murder in the prison so he will not be getting out. The warden did not believe he should waste the court's time with the charge since he was already in for a life sentence. He asks Stabler to do something.Tierney wakes up gasping for breath. Benson calms him before telling him Mollinax is not out because there has been a complication.Stabler asks him to explain what happened. Mollinax was coming back from a meal. Some Aryans jumped a black guy. His friends join in. A black guy came at him with a six-inch shank as he was walking by. He forces the guy to drop the shiv. While the guy was choking him, he grabbed the shiv and stabbed him in self-defense. Stabler tells him he will help him if his story checks out. Benson tries to calm Tierney. He tells her they better hurry.Novak tells Stabler her hands are tied considering they have him for another murder. Stabler tells her he has six witnesses backing Mollinax's plea of self-defense. She reminds him she does not have jurisdiction outside the city. He asks her to call the DA upstate, but is told he is backing the warden. Stabler recounts the fact that Mollinax served time for a murder he did not commit and now he is going to have to do more time for a murder he would not have committed had he not been there in the first place. Novak tells him there is nothing she can do legally. He asks her to do something.Benson tells Tierney they are still waiting on the word about Mollinax. She promises they will get him out. She tells him he can let go, but he refuses saying he needs to see this through. Donnelly asks Novak and Stabler if they want her to call the governor and ask for a pardon. Novak explains she will do the asking, but she needs her to get him on the phone considering they are old friends. She explains she would have to advise her friend not to get involved. The DA upstate has every right to try Tierney for murder and the governor cannot circumvent his authority. Stabler questions allowing a man to serve time for a crime he did not commit. Donnelly clarifies Mollinax must serve time for the murder he did commit. Stabler reminds her he has already served 35 years causing her to explain she did not mean he should stay in jail. Novak concludes she is suggesting the governor can pardon him for the Mollinax murder if he pleads guilty for the prison murder. He gets sentenced to time served and everyone gets what they want. Donnelly promises to get Novak in to see the governor, but tells her the rest is up to her. While pacing at the Governor's office, Stabler gets concerned that it is taking too long. He is afraid Tierney will not make it. Novak suggests they lie and tell him Mollinax is out so he can rest in peace, but Stabler refuses to lie to him. She reminds him Tierney would not know. Stabler tells her that he would know. They are interrupted to be informed the Governor has granted their request. Stabler calls Benson so she can relay the message. Benson wakes Tierney to tell him Mollinax is out. He is glad. When she starts to pull away, he grabs her hand asking her to stick around since it will not be long. She assures him she is not going anywhere. Stabler shows up with Sheila to Benson sitting in the chair beside his bed. She gets up as Sheila approaches. After exchanging sorrowful looks, Benson takes her place between Sheila and Stabler. Sheila sits down in the chair taking hold of his hand as she begins to cry.The choosing of names was mentioned a couple of times in this episode. These are the meanings and history behind some of the names mentioned. There is some interesting symbolism going on here. Clare (Elizabeth Stabler's confirmation name) is of Latin origin and means ""clear, bright, or famous."" Saint Clare of Assisi was an Italian noblewoman who was so inspired by the preaching of Saint Francis of Assisi that ran away from home at the age of 17 (along with her sister who was to become Saint Agnes) to devote her life to God. She founded the Order of Poor Ladies, also known as the 'Poor Clares' to organize women who wanted to follow the example of Saint Francis. They wore no shoes, ate no meat, lived in a poor house, and kept silent most of the time. Her feast day is August 11, and she is the patron saint of clairvoyance, eyes (Elizabeth was wearing glasses), gilders, gold, clear weather (which Tierney mentions during one of Olivia and Elliot's visits), needleworkers, Santa Clara Pueblo, telephones, telegraphs, and television.Peter (the confirmation name Dickie Stabler rejected) is of Greek origin and means ""stone."" Saint Peter (a.k.a. Simon ben Jonah, Simon Bar Jonah, Simon Peter, Cephas, Kepha-original name Simon or Simeon) was one of the Twelve Apostles whom Jesus chose from among his disciples. He and his brother, Saint Andrew, were the fishermen whom Jesus called to become 'fishers of men'. When he acknowledged Jesus as ""...the Messiah, the son of the living God,"" Christ replied, ""You are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church."" Christ also told him, ""To you I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed also in heaven."" In Roman Catholic tradition, Saint Peter was the first Bishop of Rome which also makes him the first pope. He was martyred in Rome, and a story in the apocryphal Acts of Peter says he asked to be crucified upside down so he would not be equated with Christ. Among other things, he is the patron saint of locksmiths, the career which Tierney chose to pursue when he went straight. His feast days are February 22, June 29, and November 18.Michael (the confirmation name Dickie Stabler selected) is of Hebrew origin and means ""Who is like God?"" Saint Michael, the Archangel, is the patron saint of policemen, probably because he was instrumental in expelling Satan and his followers from heaven. He is usually depicted killing a serpent. His feast day is September 29th.Sheila (Judson Tierney's daughter) is of Celtic or Gaelic origin and means ""Heaven."" If there is an afterlife, what Judson Tierney did for her might help him get there despite his crimes. Ashley (one of Tierney's granddaughters) is of English origin and means ""from the ash tree field."" Lindsey (Tierney's other granddaughter) is of English or Latin origin and means ""from the lake settlement island"". Tierney was puzzled about the girls' names, and they are the only ones in his family that have no symbolic relevance to the story.Jake (the name under which Tierney was convicted of his petty crimes) is a diminutive of Jacob, a Hebrew name meaning ""supplanter""-one who steals the place of another, especially through force or treachery. It is an ironically appropriate name considering he supplanted Sheila's father by killing him, burning the house down (both acts of force), and keeping Sheila's true parentage a secret from her (treachery). In the Bible, Jacob was the second-born of Isacc and Rebekah's twin boys. He was, smooth skinned, a homebody, a shepherd, and his mother's favorite. His elder brother Esau was hairy, a hunter who was often away from home and was his father's favorite. One day, when Esau returned home from a hunt, he was ""starving"" and sold his birthright (a double portion of his father's inheritance) to Jacob for a bowl of lentil soup. Later, when Isaac was old, blind, and near death, Jacob stole Esau's clothes and covered his arms with fleece (sheepskin with the wool attached) so that he smelled and felt like his older brother and stole Esau's blessing as well. God changed his name to Israel and he became the third Biblical patriarch after Abraham and Isaac.Judson (Tierney's chosen name after 1971, when he took Sheila and quit his life of crime) is of English origin and means son of Judd. Judd, also of English origin, is a diminutive form of Jordan, which is of Hebrew origin and means ""to flow down"". The Jordan River is widely held to be one of the world's most sacred rivers. Jacob crossed it when fleeing from his brother Esau after supplanting him by stealing his birthright and blessing, much as Tierney crossed into an honest life when he supplanted Sheila's father. It was the site of many miracles, and John the Baptist baptized Jesus in its waters. Symbolically crossing the River Jordan was the Hebrews final step to freedom in the Promised Land after fleeing slavery in Egypt and wandering in the desert for forty years. It can also represent death as the spirit crosses over into Paradise or Heaven, which is what Judson Tierney is hoping to do.Jack (the name of Tierney's partner whom he shot to rescue Sheila) is of English origin. It is a nickname for John. Both mean ""God is forgiving."""

Sennet questions if she is exercising because of her crush. When she confirms his suspicion, he tells her not to grow up too fast. Tessa asks what a ""Dallas head hunter"" is causing her social worker, Sara Jenner, to end the visit. Sennet protests stating she has ended the visits early three times in a month. Jenner claims Tessa needs the time to study since her grades are slipping. Tessa corrects her saying she made a D on one pop quiz. Before walking them to the car, Sennet reminds Jenner he still has a half hour left. At the car, Tessa tells Sennet to take care of himself as she hugs him. After they drive off, Sennet begins pressing buttons on his cell phone.While standing in the doorway of Tessa's bedroom, Valerie, her mother, tries to explain Sennet has issues he is not dealing with making him untrustworthy. Tessa puts on her headphones causing Valerie to leave her room shutting the door behind her.While Valerie is in the shower, someone rips the curtain down wrapping it around her and removing her from the shower as she screams.Valerie explains to Benson and Stabler that she could not report her rape until her 12-year-old daughter went to school claiming she does not want Tessa to know. Her attacker dragged her from the shower to her bedroom and raped her before apologizing. She adds ""like he always does"" causing Stabler to realize she knew her attacker. She identifies him as her soon-to-be ex-husband making sure they understand Tessa is not to know about it. At the station, Valerie informs Benson and Stabler of Tessa's visit with Sennet the previous day stating she returned home around 5:30 or 6:00. She believes Tessa gave her the silent treatment because she thinks Valerie is keeping her from Sennet. When she tells them the visits are supervised, Stabler questions if Sennet ever abused either of them. She asks if drug and alcohol addiction count as abuse. Stabler explains they do not count as abuse by themselves. The judge in the case disagrees with Stabler because he issued an Order of Protection. Valerie stresses Sennet was in her home and raped her before asking why they have not arrested him. Benson explains they need to finish taking her statement before they can talk to him. Stabler adds they will need to talk with Tessa. Valerie does not believe Tessa will know anything since she was asleep at the time. Benson informs her that Sennet had to have a key since there were no signs of forced entry. Valerie does not believe Tessa would give him a key or their address because she knows if he found out where they live, then they would have to move again. Stabler thinks she may have out of anger towards her. Valerie claims Tessa loves her and Sennet and questioning her will force her to choose between them. She requests they keep Tessa out of it. Stabler questions where Sennet got the key.In the squad room, Stabler informs Benson Sennet will be returning tonight from a business trip scheduled over a month prior. Benson believes it was convenient. When Cragen joins them, Benson tells him CSU found fibers at the scene along with hairs. The rape kit was positive for intercourse, but negative for semen. Stabler notes husbands do not wear condoms. Benson believes he would if he went over there to humiliate her. She thinks Tessa is angry and misses her father. She does not know if Tessa gave Sennet the key or the address reminding them they are not allowed to talk to Tessa without parental consent. Cragen will try to get Novak to find a way around that. Stabler informs him of two domestic violence calls to the Sennet residence while they were together. One was no dispensation. The other resulted in court-ordered anger management after Sennet put his fist through a wall. Neither Valerie or Tessa have a history of ER visits. Benson reminds them she grew up with an alcoholic mother stating abuse does not have to be physical to cause damage. Stabler believes more families would have protection orders and supervised visits if that was all it takes. The Restraining Order expires in a week, but the hearing to request an extension was held a month prior resulting in the request being denied. Cragen wants to know why the judge denied the request.Judge Harrison informs Benson and Stabler the original petition for an Order of Protection did not have grounds adding they are handed out like candy because jurists feel pressured by feminazis. Benson wonders why he dismissed Valerie's fears. Judge Harrison believes Valerie watched too many movies adding there was never any violence or abuse in the home. Benson tells him the violence took place the night before when Sennet raped Valerie. Judge Harrison reminds her if she had the evidence to prove it, then she would not be there. Stabler reminds him their job is to believe the victim. Judge Harrison reminds them his job is to believe whoever is lying the least. Benson does not believe Valerie has a reason to lie. Judge Harrison explains that by accusing a husband of abuse, a wife tips the case in her favor. Stabler calls it the Silver Bullet Defense while Judge Harrison calls it Sexual Assault in Divorce. Stabler tells him Kathy declined hiring a lawyer that suggested she use that strategy. Judge Harrison explains other men are not that lucky before clarifying some women do need protection while others abuse the system in order to get what they want. He believes Valerie is abusing the system. Benson asks if he has proof or if he is making it up as he goes along. Judge Harrison warns her that accusing him of Judicial Misconduct without proof could land her in jail.As they leave the courthouse, Stabler scolds Benson for baiting a judge. She reminds him Valerie was raped. She believes his family situation is clouding his judgment causing him to empathize with the suspect. He corrects her stating it is an outrage because Sennet never touched his wife. When Benson adds ""until last night"" and reminds him of the bruises, Stabler explains Sennet is being punished even though he never touched either of them. Jenner explains to Munch and Tutuola that she has picked Tessa up, supervised the visits, and taken her home for the past 6 months. At first, she thought Valerie was being overprotective, but Sennet showed up at her apartment every day demanding to see Tessa. He was never charged because he stayed 500 feet away, but Jenner still felt it was harassment. Valerie moved frequently because she fears Sennet when he is drunk or high. Jenner claims to understand her feelings stating Sennet has exhibited a temper after she shortened some visits by getting in her face. Tutuola reminds her cutting the visits short was not her call to make. Jenner cuts the questioning short stating she has to go investigate a complaint on a father for spanking his child. When Tutuola asks for her supervisor's name, she tells him to ""Go to hell"" before leaving. Tutuola takes out his notepad and begins to write causing Munch to ask if he is writing her a ticket. He explains he is filing a formal complaint because cutting visits short is an abuse of her power.At Tessa's school, Stabler questions Benson about speaking with Tessa. Benson explains it is the only way to know if Sennet was in the house. Tessa is introduced to them saying they need to ask her questions about Sennet. When Stabler asks her to sit down, Tessa wonders if Sennet is in trouble. She explains he used to have problems with drugs and alcohol. She denies telling him where she lives, but admits to leaving her backpack laying around with her house keys in it. Benson tries to convince her to tell them if she told Sennet saying no one would be angry. Tessa denies telling him again realizing they do not believe her. She denies seeing Sennet in her home the previous night. Valerie interrupts them telling Tessa to wait outside. Benson defends their actions assuring her they did not tell Tessa about the assault. She continues stating Tessa denies seeing Sennet. Stabler believes Tessa is hiding something. He explains she needs to let them do their jobs since rape is a serious charge. Valerie orders them to stay away from Tessa since they have already questioned her. Benson believes Tessa is trying to protect Sennet, but Stabler does not believe it is Sennet she is protecting.Sennet cannot believe Valerie is trying to take away his freedom after taking everything else from him. Stabler calms him stating they want to hear his side of the story. Sennet tells them he is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict as well as a lousy husband, but denies being a rapist. He clarifies for Benson that if Valerie had sex it was not with him. When Stabler tries to make sure Valerie did not back out of consensual sex at the last minute, Sennet repeats they did not have sex. Benson informs him he will have to come with them since he does not have an alibi. He questions how he can clear himself if no one knows where he was. Stabler has him agree to take a poly.At the station, Cragen urges Valerie to think before she recants her statement. She claims she knows what she is doing. They are surprised to see Benson and Stabler escorting Sennet out of the elevator. When Cragen informs them Valerie recanted. Sennet and Valerie go after each other. Before they can get physical, Benson ushers Valerie into the elevator as Stabler pins Sennet against the wall. Cragen orders a uniform to escort Sennet out allowing Stabler to add to take him down the back stairs. Benson believes Valerie recanted to stop them from talking to Tessa. Stabler believes Sennet is a hothead. Valerie and Sennet are trying to destroy each other. Tutuola joins them informing Stabler Kathy called. He continues stating the hair found at Valerie's belong to Sennet. Benson notes he knows where they live. Stabler believes Tessa transferred the hairs from her visit. Benson does not buy it. Stabler reminds her that her relationship with him is the longest she has ever had with a man so she would not know how bad things can get with couples. She fires back stating that after 8 years in SVU, she does not need to be married to know when an abusive man is escalating. She walks off in one direction and after a brief pause he goes in the other direction.In Cragen's office, Novak informs Benson and Stabler they will not be able to get a search warrant without a corroborating witness placing Sennet in the apartment. Stabler suggests they arrest Valerie for lying to police and filing a bogus police report. Benson believes that would be re-victimizing a rape victim. Stabler reminds her Valerie recanted. Benson thinks Stabler is upset because he believes Valerie is abusing the system. He clarifies if Valerie is facing jail time she would allow them to talk to Tessa. Cragen is not comfortable with the idea. Stabler explains if she lied about the rape she will be in jail and if she did not lie they will have what they need to nail Sennet. Novak agrees to arrest Valerie, but wants Huang to interview Tessa in case Valerie cannot be persuaded. After Novak leaves, Cragen asks if they can work the case together or does he need to reassign it. Benson says it is fine before getting up to leave. As Valerie picks Tessa up after school, Stabler approaches her informing her she is under arrest for Filing a False Report and Lying to Police. Benson approaches Tessa attempting to hold her back and calm her. When Valerie does not heed Stabler's warning of doing it the easy way, Benson suggests Valerie calm down and think about Tessa. Valerie assures Tessa it will be okay telling her to come with her. At the station, Tessa asks Huang what will happen. He responds saying it depends on Valerie. She believes he is treating her like a kid instead of someone with a brain. She explains she has found Sennet passed out. She has flushed his stash. As a result, Sennet would scream and yell before going out to buy more. She denies he ever hit either one of them. Sennet would break things and hit the wall instead. Huang informs her that Valerie claims Sennet raped her. Tessa does not believe he would do that.When Benson asks her if Sennet raped her, Valerie refuses to talk about it adding she wants a lawyer. Stabler informs her she is charged with two forbiddenStabler to rush over, grab her, and run as she begs for him to let her go. As soon as she is out of sight, Sennet reaches into his back pocket pulling out a long kitchen knife. Tutuola orders him to put it down and stay put. Benson makes her way from behind the statue with her gun raised. When he raises the knife aiming it at Tutuola, she yells his name getting his attention. As soon as he turns around, she shoots three times to his chest dropping him. She approaches him and removes the clip from her gun. She informs him his ribs will hurt since she used plastic bullets. She walks away allowing the others to cuff him.At the Burn Unit, the doctor explains Valerie will be going through very painful debridement. In a few days if she stabilizes, she will have surgery, a round of maggots, and then another surgery to remove dead tissue. He believes it is remarkable she has survived this long, but doubts she will survive more. Benson informs Valerie Sennet has been arrested and Tessa is in the waiting room with her parents. When Valerie asks if they killed him, Stabler notes she is out of it. Valerie tells them the shower was his fault, but she showed him. Benson questions if Sennet raped her. She confirms it. As Benson and Stabler get through the doors of the Burn Unit, Valerie screams causing them to jump. They lean against the walls slowly taking off the gowns as they listen to her horrific screams.Stabler looks at the house once he is on the porch. He puts the large manila envelope into the mailbox before ringing the doorbell and making his way back to his car. He turns around in time to see Kathy come out. She notices the envelope causing her to look at him. After a few moments, he gets in his car and drives away. She watches him leave before going back inside.In the squad room, Phillip Anderson arrives asking Benson for Stabler. He explains they were looking for him concerning the Sennet case. She informs him the case is closed. Anderson tells her he heard Valerie was in critical condition on the news. He believes she was an amazing woman. He explains their relationship was casual with him only coming over while Tessa was with Sennet. Benson tells him Valerie accused Sennet of rape so she needs to know when they were last together sexually. He confirms they were together on the 5th. He was gone before 5 so Tessa would not see him. After she verifies he used a condom, he tells her he hopes she is done prying into his sex life because he is leaving. Benson informs him Valerie is in Cornell's Burn Unit in case he wants to visit her. He reminds her the relationship was casual before leaving. As Stabler lays in bed awake at 4:47AM, he receives a text message from Benson stating ""Meet me downstairs...Liv."" When Stabler comes out of the door, Benson hands him a cup of coffee. He notices a flower in her cup as he sits down beside her. She explains it is tea causing him to realize she is serious about the change. After they confirm neither could sleep, Benson informs him Valerie was sleeping with the investigator from her lawyer's office clarifying she was not raped. When he informs her Valerie died 20 minutes earlier, Benson realizes Valerie knew she was dying and still lied. Stabler explains, ""When love warps into hate, there's nothing you won't do."" He tells her he signed the divorce papers because he did not want Kathy to ever regret him. Benson believes it is a step in the right direction. She asks if they are okay. Stabler is afraid if he disagrees with her, he will lose the partnership. When Benson questions the change, he simply responds that things change. Benson reminds him the longest relationship she has ever had with a man has been with him. She questions if anyone else would put up with her. When she asks if he is hungry, he agrees he could eat but wonders who is buying. She explains with his divorce and four kids he is. He assumed that would be the case."

Ming tells her to go away. Ming is bleeding from her nose and crying as the pounding continues. Her friend gains the assistance of their Resident Adviser Ken Randall. Her friend tells Ken that she believes Ming was raped. Ken knocks on the door and tells Ming anything she tells him will remain private. She informs him it is not a school matter causing him to tell her his father is a cop. She refuses to go anywhere causing him to offer to have his father come to the dorm. Ming does not want everyone to see a cop there. He promises her if she will talk to his father, he will help her. After a few moments, she opens the bathroom door.At the precinct, Ming tells Ken and Tutuola about her attack. She got off the subway on an empty platform and headed for the stairs. A man grabbed her and dragged her behind the pillar. He pinned her down and put his hand over her mouth. She was able to get a quick look at him to see he had a bandanna around his face before she closed her eyes. He made her tell him she liked it while he was raping her. While he was choking her, she heard people yelling stop causing him to run away. When she opened her eyes again, everyone was gone. Ken believes the people shouting must have chased the rapist. Tutuola takes the opportunity to tell Ming she is doing good before informing her the information will help them catch the guy. She does not want to go to court because her parents will find out. Ken assures her it will be okay stating she is not the first girl at Hudson to get raped. She tells them she should not have come to the station because she cannot do this before running out. When Ken acknowledges he blew it, Tutuola tells him to fix it.Ken returns to the squad room to inform Tutuola he cannot convince Ming to come back and asks what they need to do now. Tutuola informs him they cannot do anything without Ming's statement adding he cannot force her. Ken believes Ming's shock is preventing her from filing a report. Tutuola tries to explain that some victims would rather move on than to go through the rape kit, testimony, and cross-examination. Ken pleads with him to not give up. He admits he said something that scared her off and he wants to make it right.Benson approaches Tutuola stating she saw Ken downstairs. He asks if Ken told her how he screwed up. She informs him he looked upset causing Tutuola to tell her he should be. Benson reminds him Ken was trying to help and suggests he talk to her. He informs her Ming is the one throwing up roadblocks. Benson tells him to go around her. She urges him to work the case for Ken. He concedes stating he will check to see if anyone who saw Ming being attacked called it in.Tutuola asks a uniform officer why he did not file a 61 when he responded to the call about Ming's attack. The officer informs him he did not have a victim or evidence an attack occurred. Tutuola wonders if the officer is moonlighting as a crime scene tech. He explains the witnesses' description of the guy resembled the ""Unabomber"" and he has not heard of his escape. The witnesses looked stoned and were dressed like they came out of a nut house. He had his face painted and she was wearing black feathers. They claimed they just got off work at a restaurant called Joe's, Moe's, or Poe's. At Eddie Allen Poe's, Tutuola states the place looks like a freak show. The guy with his face painted tells them it is a theme restaurant while the girl with the black feathers informs them they dress like Poe's characters. She is the Raven and he is the Tell Tale Heart. Tutuola informs them he and Munch are there about the attack they witnessed the previous night. When the Raven tells them the other cop did not believe them, Tutuola informs them he believed they were stoned. The Tell Tale Heart informs them they have to be stoned to survive a night of working there. They inform them they still know a girl crying when they see it. They were on the other end of the platform so they got closer. The guy took off when they yelled. They tried to follow him, but he ducked in traffic and disappeared. When Tutuola shows them a picture of Ming asking if it was the girl they saw being attacked, they confirm it was her. The perp was wearing a navy blue hoodie, sunglasses, and a bandanna around his face. He asks them to help a sketch artist draw a composite of the guy.Ken asks Ming to look at the sketch to see if it is the guy, but she refuses. When Ken reminds her it is the only way to stop him from attacking other women, she agrees. She tells Tutuola the sketch is of the perp causing him to ask for more details. She tells him the guy talked like they were dating. He told her how good he would make her feel and that he was a good lover. He told her she is cuter than her little sister. She explains she had lunch with her and her parents, but left them around 3 and went straight to campus. Tutuola reminds her that her attack occurred at 9 and he does not believe traffic would cause it to take that long to get from Brooklyn to Manhattan. He asks if there is anything else she needs to tell him causing her to leave stating she will be late for her course.As they search the ship, Lake and Tutuola see Henry enter through a door at the end of the hall talking on a cell phone. When he sees them, he turns around and begins running. After chasing him for a few minutes, he holds an innocent boy at knife point. When they urge him to let the kid go, Henry explains he is going to make him famous. Lake tries to convince him to let him go saying no one would care about him since he is from a Third World country. He offers to let Henry take him hostage instead. As soon as the kid is out of the way, Tutuola shoots Henry in the right shoulder. Lake helps him off the ground and cuffs him as Henry questions his wound. Tutuola assures him he will live, considering it is only a flesh wound. Henry wonders if he will have a televised trial. Lake and Tutuola tell him he will. Before they can get him off the ship, they hear sirens coming. They watch as patrol cars pull up with a media van close by. Henry sees his fame is already beginning."

Tutuola yells for Munch to help Taylor. Munch suggests they shoot Cupid before checking on the unconscious boy. Cupid breaks away from Tutuola and Stabler before throwing a uniform officer towards them. When he heads towards Cragen and Benson with a bench, Cragen warns two uniforms Cupid is high on PCP giving them just enough time to move before the bench is launched their way. Stabler hits Cupid in the head with the fire extinguisher to try to stop him. Cupid throws him through the window before grabbing a chair and slinging it towards Tutuola and into another window. Benson returns from the squad room with a taser. She informs him Barbie is gone as she aims towards his abdomen. He warns Benson not to make him hurt her before she gives her final warning. He believes Benson is jealous of Barbie's beauty. When he raises the chair, she zaps him to his knees. When she stops, he pulls off the leads and begins to get up only to be stopped by Tutuola hitting him in the head with a chair. As uniform officers rush to get the cuffs on Cupid, Cragen and Benson check on Stabler. Cragen notes he has a deep cut in his arm. Benson has someone to notify EMS that an officer is down. As Stabler is being wheeled out on a gurney by EMS with Benson at his side, Cragen is informed they are being taken to Bellevue and Benson is going with him. Once they leave, Cragen notices the envelope on the floor. Tutuola informs him the kid was carrying it. Inside they find pictures of a little boy in his underwear and a note with a memory card attached to it asking them to put the guy away. In the hospital, the doctor warns Stabler that his arm will be numb after the slight pinch from the needle. Stabler informs him his arm is already numb, but is proven wrong when he feels the pinch. Cragen approaches him asking how he is feeling. When he replies that he feels like a million bucks, Benson adds it happens when you get hit by a bus. Cragen informs him Cupid is in the prison ward in steel restraints. The doctor tells them Stabler's radial nerve was almost severed. Stabler assures him he will be ready for work, but the doctor tells him he has to wait until the feeling comes back in his arm and hands. Cragen informs Stabler he would rather lose him for a few weeks than attend his retirement party. Benson tells Stabler Tutuola is talking with Taylor.From his hospital bed, Taylor asks Tutuola what happened. Tutuola tells him he picked the wrong time to get off the elevator explaining a guy in a PCP rage took him out. After explaining where he was, Taylor remembers the envelope. Tutuola assures him he got the envelope. Taylor explains a guy on the street wearing shades and a winter jacket with the hood up gave him $50 to deliver it. He was told the money was all he needed for an explanation. He pulls the bill from his pocket saying he knew it was too good to be true. In the squad room, Benson informs Cragen the bill was too beat up for prints. Tutuola adds the only prints on the envelope were his, Munch's, and Taylor's. There was no DNA. Benson adds the only other fingerprints were on the pictures, but they were not in the system. She believes the tipster's fingerprints are in the system. Cragen figures that is why he wants to go undetected, but wonders why he did not give the perp's name. Tutuola guesses he is afraid of him, like a previous victim. Benson suggests the perp is a member of the victim's family and the tipster is as well. Cragen wonders if the tipster edited out the worst of the pictures. Benson explains that they used digital image recovery software in Computer Crimes to restore erased files so maybe it would work on the memory card. Morales informs Benson and Tutuola he was able to locate JPEG files on the memory card, but the pictures were of one door from various angles. As they look at the images blown up, Benson notices writing on a truck that passes the glass door. After flipping the image and clearing it up, it reads ""Empoli Bakery."" Morales checks the EXIF data to find out when the picture was taken and by what kind of camera. The pictures were taken with a Photo Pro 600 camera. The truck passed by at 1:46 the previous Tuesday.  As Tutuola was going through the driver's route in the Empoli Bakery truck with him, the driver turns onto a dangerous block. The driver explains he would not have went that way, but a water main broke the day in question forcing him to take the route to Columbia Presbyterian. When Tutuola has him pull over, he tells him to help himself to a snack. Tutuola gets off the truck carrying two doughnuts while Benson gets out of the car behind them. He offers her one, but she declines. A little boy, Kevin, notices the exchange and asks for the doughnut. Tutuola gladly gives him one causing ""the wax man"" to question the reason for it. When Benson shows her badge, he decides to drop it. Tutuola notes it is raining and ushers everyone inside. ""The wax man"" believes they are there about the break-ins, but they do not correct him. He explains the building has had 3 break-ins in the past month. When Benson asks about the most recent one, he wonders why she does not already know about the one a few nights prior. Tutuola explains they were too busy eating to find out the information. ""The wax man"" informs them the super is Seth Millstead. His apartment is in the basement and was the most recent one to be robbed. In Millstead's apartment while Benson is on the phone, Millstead wonders if the police communicate because he denies the break-in ever occurred. Tutuola informs him the door and ""the wax man"" say otherwise. When Millstead claims ""the wax man"" is too strung out to know anything, Tutuola request permission to look around which Millstead grants as Benson ends her call. Benson explains 2 patrol cars were sent after a call was received about a break-in to his apartment. He explains he told the other cops that he locked his keys in the apartment and it is cheaper to break-in and fix the door rather than call a locksmith. Tutuola interrupts them saying he understands Millstead's reasoning asking him to call with any more problems. Once outside the door. Benson questions why he pulled her out. Tutuola explains Millstead is lying and they do not have a warrant for his digital camera, which is the same make and model as the one that took the pictures. He believes the person that broke-in got more than they bargained for. Benson realizes they have a burglar with a conscience. As he and Tutuola walk into his office, Cragen explains he does not believe a burglar would risk prison time to be a Good Samaritan. Tutuola reminds him they did not find prints or DNA on the envelope or pictures. He suspects the perp stopped four blocks away to look at the things he stole. When he found the kiddie porn, he decided to call it in. When Cragen still sounds doubtful, Tutuola reminds him burglars do not necessarily like kiddie porn. When they arrive at the board in the squad room, Cragen questions why the guy reported his crime. Tutuola guesses he wanted to make sure they were able to link the kiddie porn to the right person. Cragen tells him the guy should have given him the address because it was luck that they found it. Cragen reminds them the guy could not have known the pictures of the door was on the card causing them to wonder why the pictures were taken. Benson explains the landlord was looking at fines because of the ten break-ins in the building within the year because of the lack of a front door. The pictures were taken to prove to the city that the door was installed. When Benson informs them Millstead does not have any priors, Tutuola reminds them he has not been caught yet. Cragen asks Munch as he joins them if the kid in the pictures lives in the building. Munch informs them his name is Diego Benitez from A-6. Munch explains he was late because he was showing the picture of Diego to the local elementary school principal. His emergency contact is his mother who is probably serving lunch.At Tenerio's Café, Benson asks Jennifer Benitez to step down so they can speak about Diego. Benson explains they believe he may have been sexually abused. She explains the only ones he is around are his teacher and the guy who watches him while she works her other job, but she does not believe they would hurt him. When she tells him she will talk to him, Benson explains it is best that they speak with him. She assures them she will get him far away from whoever is hurting him and she will get him help. Benson shows her the pictures of Diego saying they could already be on the internet. The best way to handle it is to arrest the guy. She hands the pictures back to Benson saying she has to go. Tutuola notes something has her spooked. Benson thinks she knows it is Millstead and is afraid of him. Tutuola thinks she may be sleeping with Millstead and is trying to protect him. Tutuola reminds her they did not get permission to talk to Diego. Benson suggests they look for the 911 caller. Munch should have the tape.In the squad room, Munch plays the tape of the call for Benson and Tutuola. They realize the caller is ""the wax man"".In the interrogation room, ""the wax man"" will not stop cleaning his ears causing Tutuola to ask him to stop. ""The wax man"" explains he has a cerumen problem causing him to produce too much earwax which will clog his auditory canals if he does not keep cleaning his ears. Munch tells him he needs a hearing test before playing the tape of the 911 call. ""The wax man"" tells him he is not deaf. Tutuola points out the tape is of him talking to the police. ""The wax man"" claims he was being a good citizen. When he claims he heard the burglary in the basement because he was home, they remind him there are 5 slabs of concrete between his apartment and Millstead's. He claims he was having a good ear day. Watching the interview from his office, Cragen asks Benson where they found this guy. She explains he was hanging around the front of Millstead's building. His real name is Raymond Nesbit. He has a long arrest record for Heroine Possession. He is on parole after doing 2-1/2 at Fulton for Burglary Two. Cragen figures old habits die hard. As the interrogation continues, Nesbit explains he watches Diego after school while his mother works. When Tutuola asks if he is into little boys, Nesbit tells him not to pin any kiddie diddling on him causing Munch to question if Diego confided in him about being abused. Nesbit denies saying that. Tutuola tells him they do not speak his ""dialect of crazy"" asking him to talk to him straight. Nesbit affirms Diego told him Millstead took pictures of him in his underwear. When they show him the pictures from the envelope, Nesbit wonders where they got them. They explain a messenger dropped them off and they believe it was the same guy who broke into Millstead's apartment. Nesbit believes the guy should keep his mouth shut unless he is able to walk on other crimes he committed. In his office, Cragen informs Novak Nesbit committed 10 burglaries in the building since he returned from prison a year prior. A crowbar was used to gain access to all 10 apartments and nothing was taken but cash. Benson suspects it was to feed his heroine habit causing Novak to say that makes it alright. She wants him arrested for his parole violation and sent back to prison. She wants to get a statement from the victim. Benson reminds her they cannot get parental consent to talk to him. Cragen informs her Nesbit is the only one who can testify kiddie porn was found in Millstead's apartment, but he will not testify unless they cut him a deal. Novak wonders what would happen if he commits an assault after they let him go and the media finds out they had him proving her point. Novak offers to let him walk on the Millstead burglary only if he confesses to taking the kiddie porn. Cragen does not believe he will go for it. Tutuola tells her they need to get a warrant for Millstead's apartment. Novak tells them they need something besides the camera. Benson reminds them the memory card has images of Diego and the front door. Novak agrees to try Judge Ahearn since she has a kid the same age as Diego.Millstead's door is forced open as an officer announces they have a search warrant. Benson approaches Millstead announcing he is under arrest for Possession of Child Porn with Tutuola by her side. Tutuola tells him it is about him rewriting history and lying about a break-in. When Benson tells him of the pictures of a boy in his underwear, Millstead notes it does not sound like any child porn he has heard of. Novak shows the Judge the pictures claiming it is child porn. Zeirko, Millstead's attorney, believes she has x-ray vision since there are no genitals or a sex act being performed. When Novak scoffs at the implication they are only family photos, Zeirko shows her a picture of his 4-year-old daughter in a two-piece questioning if it is child porn. She explains if he sells it to a pedophile, then it is. Novak argues Justice Stewart said he would know child porn if he saw it. She sites US v. Dost saying they must consider what the child is wearing and the intent of the image. Zeirko adds they must consider if the child is naked or performing a sex act. The Judge explains he is not giving a perp a free ride without researching Novak's points promising a ruling the following day. He adds she needs a statement from the victim for the search warrant to stick.Benson arrives at the Benitez apartment. When she informs her of Millstead's arrest, Jennifer wonders if he believes she talked. Benson assures her she does not need to worry he will report her illegal status. She explains she knows Jennifer's green card expired the year prior. She pleads with Benson not to send them back to Honduras adding Diego was born here. Benson explains she is there to help Diego. Jennifer allows her to enter her home where she sees a tired Diego sitting on the couch. After she introduces herself, she shows Diego the pictures of him and asks if he has seen them. He denies seeing them or knowing who took them. Benson takes her coat off after suddenly becoming hot due to the heat. Diego does not remember if anyone asked him to pose for the picture. Jennifer notices Benson is not acting right and shows concern for her well being by offering to get her some water. Once she is out of the room, Benson turns her attention back to Diego to find him unconscious. When she gets up, she is dizzy and her vision is blurred. Suddenly she hears glass breaking in th kitchen causing her to check it out. When she sees Jennifer on the floor, she moves her to the other room. She locates a window and breaks it to vent the apartment before carrying Diego and Jennifer out. She yells for help telling tenants to call for help and to get everyone out of the building before collapsing against the wall. Cragen arrives on the scene recounting to Tutuola he knows of 12 victims, including Jennifer, Diego, and Benson. Tutuola explains the other victims occupied two other apartments. Patrol evacuated the building. Hazmat is ready to go in. Emergency Services is looking for any other victims. When Cragen asks about the condition of the victims, Tutuola informs him Benson is the only one not at the ER. They make their way to the ambulance where Benson is telling EMS she does not need to go to the hospital, but is reminded they do not know what made her pass out. Cragen and Tutuola interrupt them only to be told she is refusing medical treatment. Cragen assures him Benson would not violate procedure by not going. When she attempts to convince him she does not need to go, Cragen tells him to restrain her if he has to in order to take her. Tutuola informs Cragen the Red Cross is setting up a temporary shelter for the evacuated tenants at a school around the corner. O'Halloran informs them Benson's actions stopped more people from getting sick before asking about her.As Benson is being wheeled into the ER, she hears a girl from the building screaming her desire to go home. She is told of the other two families effected being exposed longer to the poisonous vapors in the apartment. O'Halloran informs Cragen and Tutuola the gas sniffer he will be using should tell them the poison they are dealing with. When he comments it is standard for the War on Terror, Cragen wonders if they located a terrorist lab. With his first stop being the basement, O'Halloran explains TARU has him hooked up to audio and video with a monitor next to the Hazmat truck so they can watch. After the doctor orders aa blood gas and a tox screen, she orders oxygen causing Benson to wonder why she needs it. She is only told it is to bring up her oxygen saturation. As a nurse is working on her, Benson notices Diego being wheeled out on a gurney and questions his whereabouts. The nurse explains he is going to Pediatrics.O'Halloran informs Cragen he is getting a reading for VOC (volatile organic compounds). He explains there are VOCs in paint thinner, gasoline, benzine, and old floor wax. He is called over to a 95-gallon over pack container, which are designed to transport 55-gallon barrels leaking chemicals and are used for nuclear waste. The container does not have any markings to tell them what is in it, but the PID tells them it is organophosphates. The doctor informs Benson that her blood work shows she has half of the cholinesterase she should have. It is an enzyme that helps regulate the nervous system. The levels drop when you have been exposed to organophosphates. She explains she will give her a shot of atropine, which is an antedote. She should be better in 24 hours. Benson is told is told she must stay overnight in hopes they can find out which one made her sick. O'Halloran tells Cragen the PID is reading the organophosphate as unknown therefore they must notify the EPA, the Terrorism Task Force, and Homeland Security. Cragen wonders if there is a sleeper cell in the building. O'Halloran informs him the terrorists in the Tokyo subway attacks in '95 used Sarin gas, one of the deadliest organophosphates. Tutuola realizes they are talking about nerve gas. O'Halloran decides to leave the container alone and check the individual apartments. In the hospital, Benson wakes up to Jennifer standing next to the gurney. Jennifer explains she was told Benson saved them. She explains the doctors ran some tests on Diego and found cancer in his blood. The doctors do not know what caused the cancer.O'Halloran explains to Tutuola and Cragen they found the organophosphate on the heaters in all 3 apartments. He guesses it must have been sprayed in the apartments and the heat from the heaters sent it into the air. They do not know how the other apartments were not in the same condition. Tutuola needs to talk to Millstead. At Rikers Island's front desk, Officer Bates questions if Tutuola needs to speak with Millstead. When it is confirmed, Bates calls his supervisor before telling Tutuola he will have to wait. He wonders if Millstead needs time to pretty himself first. Zeirko arrives wondering why Tutuola is there. Tutuola explains he is there to see Millstead. Zeirko believes Rikers called Tutuola before calling him. As they make there way to Millstead, Zeirko explains that during Millstead's daily exercise in the yard there was a pile-up. When the guards got everyone off of Millstead, there was a sharpened toothbrush sticking out of hie rib cage. Zeirko tells him they have about a dozen suspects. As they pull the sheet from Millstead's dead body, Tutuola sarcastically comments, ""It could not have happened to a nicer guy.""In Cragen's office as he puts his roll-a-way bed away, Tutuola tells him of the attack on Millstead. The weapon hit Millstead's ascending aorta only allowing a minute before death. Cragen notes their only lead on the toxin died with Millstead before explaining Homeland Security and the FBI took over the case adding they want Millstead's kiddie porn as well. Benson arrives questioning whether they are giving up. When she informs them she is wearing scrubs because Hazmat confiscated her clothes, Cragen tells her she could have gone home. She informs him she is not going home until she finds out what happened to her. Cragen explains they may not have that information for days and their role in the case is over. Munch interrupts telling them they should see what was found in Millstead's apartment first. In the squad room, the team watches a tape of Millstead talking to Diego. He asks him to remember 3 words before talking to him about school, which he is struggling. Munch explains the mini DV tapes were found under a floorboard in Millstead's apartment. When Novak tells him she does not need to see the boy being abused on camera, Munch assures her it is G-rated before continuing the tape. Before allowing him to go, Millstead asks for the words. Even though Diego repeats the wrong ones, Millstead tells him he did good. Munch tells them they have over 200 sessions of Diego and the other kids at the hospital. Munch informs them Millstead was getting quarterly checks from EHD Associates. He explains the company does research for chemical companies, but the offices and bank accounts disappeared 2 days prior. He explains the chemical in the basement is an experimental pesticide that EHD Associates is paying Millstead to test it on the kids in the building and the tapes are evidence of the long-term effects on the kids. When Tutuola tells him the thought is out there even for him, Munch points out that Millstead was listed as a consultant with the company. In the morgue, Warner tells Tutuola and Benson Munch is not crazy. She explains it would not be the first time a company poisoned people. She explains the government tried to pay poor families in Jacksonville, Florida to videotape the effects of pesticides on their children. The only reason they stopped was because of public protest and their own scientists. The EPA prohibits all testing on pregnant women and children. Companies get around this by using Observational Testing. If you spray for bugs, they can observe how the chemical effects them. She believes the pictures are proof of toxicity to show any rashes on the skin. When Benson questions what pesticide they are talking about, Warner explains the company has to submit all data to the EPA for final approval. While standing outside the building watching the removal of the 95-gallon container, the EPA representative explains to Tutuola and Benson that they do not know what the chemical is because they do not deal with the companies until the have all of their data ready for approval. Benson reminds him the only reason the study was not completed was because kids almost died. He assures them the EPA's hands are clean on this causing Tutuola to slam him into the car. When Tutuola reminds him of CHEERS, he explains they only used people who were already using the stuff, which are the poor. Benson tells him the chemical companies seem to be allowed to do whatever they want, but he corrects her saying they have to follow certain rules and guidelines. She does not believe the company asked for permission before exposing the families to the pesticide. He assures her the company would not open themselves to a multi-million dollar lawsuit by not getting permission. In Diego's hospital room, Benson questions if Jennifer signed a form giving them permission to spray the apartment. Jennifer explains Millstead told her she would get a hundred dollars every few months if she signed the form to allow Millstead to spray the drug in the apartment. Benson verifies she was told it was a drug instead of a poison or a pesticide. Jennifer confirms Millstead told her it was safe. Benson assures her it was not her fault because she did not know, but Millstead probably did. Jennifer tells her Diego needs chemotherapy, but she does not have medical insurance or money to pay for it. Jennifer confirms Millstead gave her a copy of the form she signed. It is in her apartment. In the Benitez apartment, Tutuola believes the EPA should clean up the apartment before they come home. Benson finds the form and begins reading over it. She understands why Jennifer did not understand it when she is having a hard time reading the legalese. She reads a portion that basically says EHD Associates cannot be held responsible for anything before turning a few pages to add Danforth Chemical, the contracting company, cannot be held responsible. Tutuola notes the big company contracted their dirty work out to the lowest bidder. Benson states she would not let a Fortune 500 company get away with this. At Danforth Chemical, Benson meets Charley Moss, attorney for Danforth Chemical, instead of the CEO of the company, Mr. Roger Hanley. When Moss claims Hanley is too busy to speak with her, Benson suggests Hanley does not have the guts to deal with her himself. After introducing herself and producing her badge, she informs him the poison sprayed almost killed her. Moss reminds her she used her position for personal business meaning she entered the building under false pretenses. She explains 11 others were also poisoned and she is there to find out what they were poisoned with. Moss tells her he cannot help her without a subpoena and suggests she leave the building. When the security guard tries to escort her out, she warns him she will arrest him for assaulting a cop if he touches her again. Moss instructs her to leave before he calls the police to have her arrested for trespassing causing her to finally leave. Novak tries to persuade Benson to hire a civil attorney to settle the matter with Danforth Chemical. Benson assures her that the fight is not about money. Novak explains Moss called the District Attorney about her abusing her power and her being on the case is a conflict of interest. Benson defends herself saying Danforth Chemical abused their power when they committed 12 counts of Assault Two. Novak reminds her the case is not an SVU case. Novak interrupts Benson's recitation of the legal definition of the charge to inform her she will have to prove intent. Benson reminds her they treated the people like lab rats adding she wants to stick it to the EPA. Novak quickly informs her federal agencies have blanket immunity. Benson wonders who they hold accountable for Diego's follicular lymphoma. Novak tells her if she were thinking like a cop, instead of a victim, she would realize it is not that simple. Benson believes it is no different from Tuskegee or Willowbrook. Novak clarifies Millstead was the one who sprayed the poison and he is dead before adding if she wants to charge Danforth Chemical she has to prove their chemical caused Diego's cancer. Warner informs Benson she cannot testify the chemical caused Diego's cancer because it is impossible to prove. Diego is the only one with cancer. The children were exposed to the chemical for two years, as well as asbestos, lead paint, cockroach and rodent droppings. The cancer could be caused by any of them, combination of them, or none of them. Cancer comes from genetics and environment. Warner adds she still would not be able to testify if they found 10 people in the building with the cancer.As Benson concentrates on her computer screen at close to midnight, Stabler arrives explaining he could not stay away for the required two weeks so he came when Cragen would not be there. When she agrees with the feeling, he verifies Cragen ripped her for her visit at Danforth Chemical. He reminds her he has spies everywhere. When he questions if she should be doing this to herself, she wonders if he thinks she should give up as well. He tries to explain he thinks it is great she is passionate about it, but is interrupted when she tells him it is easy to be passionate when you are a victim. He is glad she admits to being a victim. He reminds her she tells victims to get help, but she is not following her own advice. She explains if she hires a lawyer, Danforth Chemical will bury her in paperwork for the next ten years and Diego could be dead by then. She adds that she cannot find out what made them sick because it is proprietary information. Stabler advises her that ""Sometimes the only way to beat someone in a dirty fight is to get right down into the gutter with them.Morales is astonished at what Benson asks him to do. She begs him not to ask her to repeat herself. When he wonders why she cannot do it herself considering she worked in Computer Crimes, she explains she was not there long enough to learn. He tells her he never thought she would break the law. She says she is desperate because she got no where playing fair and she needs the information to get the subpoena. He questions whether it is worth losing their jobs and going to prison. She believes it is because it will prove a big chemical company is intentionally poisoning little kids. She assures him there will be no hard feelings if he decides not to help her.In the Men's Room at Danforth Chemical, Benson balances Morales's laptop on her knees at the same time she is balancing on her feet on a toilet in one of the stalls. When she questions their location, Morales explains he needed a signal and no one can see them in there. Once he has hacked into their system, Benson explains they need the names of any experimental pesticides in the testing stage. The computer beeps alerting them to Danforth's Wireless Intrusion Detection System. Morales explains it will get louder the closer they get to locating them. While there are no pesticides in the testing stage, there is one awaiting EPA approval. Zilithion. He shuts the computer, grabs his bag, and leaves. When Benson gets out of her position and begins to leave, two security guards come in. She tells them she thought it was the Ladies' Room and leaves. Munch and Benson make their way into Hanley's meeting despite his receptionist's protests. As Benson handcuffs Hanley, she explains he is under arrest for 12 counts of Assault with Zilithion. Hanley tells them he is not a criminal. Munch tells him what his company does to kids is criminal.At the precinct, Munch takes Hanley's mug shot. Munch tells Hanley he is done, but is told they are all done when Moss gets there. Munch tells him that until Moss gets there, he can stay in the ""prisoner lounge."" When he requests preferential treatment, Munch scoffs at giving special treatment to a plutocrat adding they would all lose their jobs. Moss arrives telling Munch they will lose it anyway before asking about Hanley's well being. Hanley asks him to get him out of there, but Moss informs him they need to get rid of the media circus the detectives called. Benson walks up behind him denying they did saying it is against department policy. Munch tells Moss anyone could have called them because the place has more leaks than a 100-year-old water main. Moss demands to see Novak. Novak arrives to the interrogation room with Benson. Moss tells them to enjoy their practical joke because it is about to explode in their faces. She tells him the only thing bursting is his bubble. When Moss tries to say he will talk to the DA, Novak informs him the DA approved everything including Hanley's arrest. Hanley denies assaulting anyone. Benson tells him he assaulted her and 11 others with Zilithion. Moss assures them they had signed releases. Benson holds up Jennifer's copy sating it is a pile of crap that refers to the pesticide as a drug. Hanley claims his company did not do anything wrong causing Benson to question if he even cares about poisoning little kids. Novak reminds them they did not get permission from the foster family with the 3 mentally handicapped kids. Hanley tells her it was legal. Benson explains they slithered through a loophole in the EPA regulations and used the kids as lab rats. Moss does not believe they can prove Hanley had direct knowledge of any of it. Novak tells him her subpoena to his IT department will not turn up any incriminating e-mails if he did not know about it. When she notices the worried look on Hanley's face, she assures him he will go to jail. Benson shows him a picture of Diego and informs him he has cancer after breathing his nerve gas for two years. Novak tells him he will pay lifetime medical expanses for him and every other tenant in the building. In return, they will drop all charges, blame everything on the research company, and will announce publicly they are cooperating with their investigation. Benson adds the media circus will go away. When Novak tells them the offer has a half-life of ten seconds, Hanley agrees.In Mercy General's play room, Benson explains that Jennifer will have to sign an agreement to never tell anyone what happened. Jennifer agrees stating she can take care of her son now. She notes Diego looks like his father and she hopes he can be strong like him. Benson assures her he will be because he has a strong mother. Benson turns to leave, but is stopped by Jennifer wanting Diego to say good-bye. Benson wants him to play."

Tommy informs him they had tried calling her, but she was not answering the phone. Truex believes she was asleep. When Tommy asks him when he is moving back home, he responds that he hopes it will be soon. Truex tries to explain that, although he and his mother, Maura, are not together, they still love him very much. Once in the home, Tommy asks him to stay the night. Truex makes him a deal. If he goes straight to bed, he will tuck him in and read his favorite story. While they are having their conversation, someone comes up behind them and hits Truex on the head with a lamp. Tommy runs screaming in search of Maura. When he gets to her bedroom, he finds his mother unresponsive on her bed covered in a sheet. He runs back, pushes the panic button, and sits in a doorway cuddling his teddy bear.As Benson and Stabler make their way up the stairs, Warner explains Truex is still unconscious at Mercy. At hearing the name, Benson verifies they are talking about the mob attorney. Warner informs them he had been hit on the head. The security company found him on the floor when they responded to the panic button. The alarm was either not set or Truex disarmed it when he came in. Maura had been raped, sodomized, and bludgeoned, and she slowly bled to death. There is no DNA because she had been assaulted with a candlestick. Stabler notes the perp has anger issues before asking about forensics. A partial bloody tennis shoe print is pointed out. Warner tells them the only other person not accounted for that lives in the house is a 16-year-old daughter, Charlotte, but she is not home. Stabler wonders where she is at one o'clock in the morning. Warner tells him Tommy had indicated to her that Charlotte was spending the weekend at a friend's house. Stabler asks if Tommy saw the attacker. Warner tells him Tommy is pretty traumatized, so patrol waited for them to interview him. When Benson asks her where Tommy is, Warner wordlessly points the way.Benson knocks on the door jamb before entering the room where Tommy is sitting still with his bear and staring into space. She introduces herself before asking him to tell her what happened. When she leans down in front of him, she explains she needs for him to be a big boy and tell her what happened. After a brief pause, he looks at her and tells her a monster hurt his daddy. When a Cragen arrives in the squad room dressed in formal attire, Benson asks where his top hat is. He explains Councilman Baker's daughter got married and he had been paged at the after party by the Chief of Detectives to get some answers on the Truex case. Stabler believes it was personal. He does not believe Maura was a random target. Cragen wonders if there was a dissatisfied client who was sending a message. Benson wonders if the perp was after Sidney and did not know they were separated. When Cragen questions if Maura was the one against whom someone had a grudge, Benson explains she was a sales representative for Tauscher-Leto Pharmaceuticals. Stabler adds that it is difficult to run a background check on the family so early on a Saturday. He suggests they find out from Charlotte, but is told she is still MIA. Stabler adds they found the family phone book in the kitchen and are using it to locate Maura's friend. Cragen informs them he will have the CO at the 15th to post an officer outside Truex's hospital room. Tutuola interrupts them to inform them a family friend said Charlotte spends her weekends with Jennifer Brown. Stabler does not want to tell her the news over the phone and he and Benson leave so they can tell her in person.Benson tells Jennifer they need to speak with Charlotte. Jennifer claims Charlotte had left before she woke up. Benson asks where she went so early and is told she may have gone home. Jennifer's mother interrupts and asks who they are. Benson shows her badge and informs her they were told Charlotte had spent the weekend there. Her mother asks Jennifer if she lied to the detectives before telling Benson and Stabler Charlotte is not allowed in her home. She explains Charlotte was a good girl until she started lying and skipping school. She believes she may be on drugs. Jennifer's mother tells Jennifer that Charlotte is only using her to cover for her before walking away. Jennifer stops Benson and Stabler as they try to leave telling them Charlotte is not a bad person. Maura would not let her see Ryan Bedford, so she has to lie to see him. She tells them he lives at The Packard on First Avenue.Ryan answers his door after Stabler flashes his badge. Stabler explains they are looking for Charlotte before asking if she is there. Ryan asks if he is under arrest, which causes Benson to ask if he should be. He defends himself by saying her parents do not like him, but she is 16 and he is 19, and it is not a crime. When Stabler asks where his parents are, he is told St. Bart's before Bedford tells him to tell Maura he will talk Charlotte into going home and she is fine. Benson tells him they will talk to her themselves. Bedford calls for Charlotte and tells her the police are there. As Charlotte walks down the stairs, she thinks her parents had sent them to freak her out. Stabler tries to explain there has been an accident, but she thinks it is a trick. Benson tells her to get dressed and come with them. She refuses. Stabler tells her that her parents had been assaulted before telling her to get dressed. He further explains that Maura is dead and Truex is in the hospital. Bedford offers to go with her, but she tells him to stay and she needs to be with Tommy.As Huang watches Tommy draw at Stabler's desk, Benson and Stabler escort Charlotte into the room. When Tommy hears his sister say his name, he runs up the stairs and tells her to go away from him. She asks what is wrong with him. Huang explains he is traumatized from watching Truex get attacked and adds he will be all right in time. Charlotte tells them that Tommy likes their Aunt Amy in Riverdale, so they could stay with her. Huang agrees to set it up before excusing himself to check on Tommy. Benson informs her Truex is still in surgery and they will not know anything for a few hours. Stabler asks if anyone has threatened her family. Charlotte wonders if he is joking. Half the city hates Truex for the cases he tries. He had hired a private investigator because of everything that had been happening. Garbage was being spread in their garden and his car was spray-painted with curses.The private investigator shows Benson and Stabler pictures of the things done to the Truex family. Garbage is on the doorstep. Bags of excrement are set on fire on the stoop. Swastikas are painted on the front door. The family cat had been dismembered and returned in several boxes. Sidney had moved out to protect the family. They are told the suspect is Luccio Ricci. Truex had defended his father, but lost the case, and Ricci blames Truex for his family losing everything they had owned. He shows them a file of Truex's hate mail. He explains the letters were unsigned, but he had taken them to a handwriting analyst with writing samples from his trash who confirmed he had written them. Stabler notes it was enough to take it to the police. The investigator wanted to do that, but Truex felt bad for losing the case and did not want him to pursue it further. Ricci now spends his time in San Marco Hall in Little Italy.Benson and Stabler arrive at San Marco Hall armed with the picture of Ricci. They locate him immediately as he plays cards with two others. They tell him they need to talk about Truex. He tells them he charged them a fortune for losing his father's case. Benson shows him the pictures of the damage he had done. He denies ever hurting Truex. When Stabler clarifies he just threatened Truex and his family, Ricci claims he was just playing. Benson reminds him he did 18 months for playing when a jury called it aggravated assault, at which Ricci claimed he had been framed. As Benson answers her ringing cell, Stabler asks if Ricci was upset because Truex had his freedom. Ricci repeats he never hurt Truex and adds he should ask him. Benson ends her call and tells him they will asking him because he had just awakened.Benson assures Truex that Tommy was not hurt. Stabler informs him they heard about the vandalism, threats, and hate mail he suffered at the hands of Ricci. Truex assures them he stopped the harassment when he moved out. When he questions if they believe Ricci killed Maura, Benson turns the question back on him, but he does not remember. He explains the doctors think he has some temporary memory loss. Benson asks him to take them through what he does remember. He remembers walking Tommy upstairs to his bedroom. He felt a pain in his head. He fell down. He thinks he blacked out for a second. When he stops recounting the events, Stabler urges him to continue. He admits he saw Charlotte running down the hallway, which caused him to believe she had killed Maura.In the interview room, Charlotte denies being at home. When Stabler informs her that Truex had seen her there, she claims he says a lot of things that are not true and adds her father lies for a living because he is a lawyer. Benson thinks they do not get along, but she corrects her saying he is never home. The only way she knows what he is doing is by watching the news. Charlotte claims Maura's idea of parenting was to lock her up so she would not have to deal with her. Stabler notes Maura's method did not work well. Charlotte tells them she got around her rules causing Stabler to comment on her using her friends to cover for her so she could go out with Bedford. She explains she had to because Maura hated him for no reason and would not allow them to be together. Benson reminds her they know she was with Bedford on Friday night before asking what they did. She tells them she and Bedford had gone to a friend's house to get wasted. When they left there, she claims they crashed until Benson and Stabler woke them up. Stabler tells her they need the names of everyone at her friend's house, but she refuses to drag her friends into it. Benson persuades her by threatening to question every student in her school.At Hanover Day School, Jane Williams denies being at a party and claims she had been babysitting until late. One of her male friends claims he was at his house with his friend watching a game all night. Another male friend says he was home all night writing a term paper that was due the following week. Susan tells them she was at the movies with Jane until after midnight. When Stabler informs her that Jane had said she was babysitting, she changes her story saying they watched the movies while Jane was babysitting. Benson wants the name of the family so they can check out the story, and Susan admits they had a party.Stabler escorts the other three friends back to the steps to join Benson and Susan. They are not thrilled that Susan had ratted them out. Benson informs them Charlotte admitted to being drunk that night. Stabler tells them they just want to know what Charlotte did that night. One of them announces she did baby blues, but is called a moron for not realizing they meant where she was. Benson tries to clarify Charlotte was on drugs and is told ""I guess.""Kathy Stabler answers the door to her husband, and he tells her they need to talk. She tells him she saw the news and knew he did not kill Bedford. He confirms it has been a rough couple of days. He has had time to think about what is important to him. He loves his job and he loves his family. He almost lost both. He tells her he wants to come home."

She informs him everything he tells her in confidential and she will use his information for a recommendation. Stabler tells her that Olivia Benson is experienced, professional, and good with the victims. Benson and Stabler are next seen in New Jersey outside of a house. Benson is looking through binoculars when New Jersey police find them. The Jersey Police ask what Benson and Stabler are doing in New Jersey if they're from Manhattan. Benson says that she is not at liberty to tell them what case they were working on. They are then informed that they are not at liberty to return back to Manhattan and are taken to the New Jersey Headquarters. In the car on the way, Stabler tells Benson that he is there to make sure that she doesn't do anything stupid, but Benson tells him that what she is working on is personal.Benson is talking to the psychiatrist. She tells her that she knows why she must talk to her, but doesn't agree with it. The psychiatrist asks Benson what Stabler is like, in which Benson replies by saying that he is the best -- smart, brave, and dedicated. She also says that she could tell him anything.Benson is then seen at the New Jersey Police headquarters. She still keeps closed-mouthed and refuses to tell why she was in New Jersey. Captain Millfeild, the captian, then informs her that she is free to go, and that Captian Cragen knows all about it and informed her they'd never come back to New Jersey.At the precinct, Cragen asks Benson and Stabler what they were doing in New Jersey. Benson and Stabler make up an excuse and say they were working on a four year old case. Cragen doesn't believe them, but informs them that while they were A.W.O.L, a man was raped.Benson and Stabler go to talk to the rape victim, whose name is Ronnie. Ronnie describes the rapists, but refuses to testify because he doesn't want his wife to find out.Benson and Stabler go back to the precinct to tell the squad that Ronnie won't look at mug shots or testify. Munch points out that every van that the rapists drove was different for each rape and that they must be stealing one for each attack. Cragen tells Benson and Stabler to take Ronnie for a walk in the park and see what he remembers. Benson gets a phone call and says that she won't be able to go.Benson goes to Huang's office, where he greets her with Simon Marsden's records. He tells her that his DNA is the in the record because he shoplifted when he was younger. Huang asks what else Benson knows about him, and she tells him what she saw the other night in New Jersey. Huang asks what she is really looking for. She tells him it's personal, but he guesses that it has something to do with her father. Benson then tells him that Simon Marsden is her brother and that they have the same father.At the precinct, Cragen asks where Benson is. He is answered by Stabler, who tells him that she had some urgent personal business. Stabler says that they found two possible vehicles involved in the attacks. Tutuola says that their next step is to run survelience on the park. They remember that the attacks took place on Friday and Saturday nights and since it was a Saturday, the rapists would most likely attack again. They decide to parole the park, but Cragen worries that they might not have enough people without Benson.Benson goes to visit Marsden's girlfriend, Lucy, in New Jersey. Lucy informs Benson that Marsden is not home. Benson suggests that she and Lucy should talk and gives Lucy her number.Meanwhile, Stabler is shown talking to the psychiatrist again. He informs her that even though Benson is under stress, it's nothing that she can not handle.As Benson is leaving Lucy and Marsden's house, Captain Millfield finds her and tells her that Benson promised she was stay away. Millfield takes Benson to a bar, where she asks Benson what else she knows about Marsden. She also tells her that she thinks Marsden is stalking women, and without help from Benson, she is stuck. Benson tells her that she's working tonight and leaves.Benson then meets Stabler in a parole car. As they watch for the van the rapists are driving, Stabler notices that something is wrong with Benson. She tells him that Marsden might be a rapist, like father like son. She also tells him that she regrets looking for him, and that she has been alone her whole life. She appologizes for whining, and Stabler consoles her by telling her that family is everything. Tutuola calls Benson and Stabler over the radio and informs them that he and Munch spotted a suspicious van. Stabler says that he and Benson will split up in to two different cars and follow the van.As Benson gets in to a seperate car, her cell phone rings. It is Lucy, Marsden's girlfriend. They plan to meet at a bar the next night. Over the radio, Stabler gives Benson specific instructions to go east on Seventy-Second street. Benson juggles between her conversation with Lucy and turns west instead of east. Stabler finds her and yells at her, asking why she went the wrong way. She said that she did not hear his instructions, and he asks her why she gave him the indictation that she did hear by saying, ""Copy, El."" Benson then hears over the radio that another man was raped and she goes to the hospital.At the hospital, the victim described the rapists and the attack, but refused to identify them.Back at the precinct, Cragen asks Huang for help. Huang points out that only the first victim was gay. He also thinks that the rapist raped because he was raped in the past. They come to the conclusion that the rapist must be an ex-con, because men get raped in prison. Cragen commands them to check the victim's description against recent paroles to see if any match. Munch and Tutuola leave, and Cragen confront Benson and Stabler about the previous night. He asks how the rapists got away, and Stabler covers for Benson by saying that he gave her unclear directions. Cragen doesn't believe him, so he goes to the Technical Assistance Response Unit. There, he listens to the radio tapes. He finds out that Benson was talking to somebody on the phone and wonders who it is.Benson goes to the bar to meet Lucy, but is surprised when Marsden shows up instead. She automatically backs out and says that meeting him was a mistake and that she thought he was someone else. Marsden suspects she's lying, and tells her that he did research on the net. He found out that Benson was a police officer, and accuses her of being with the cops who are watching him and making his life miserable. He recognizes her and asks if they had met before. She tells him again that she had made a mistake.Back at the precint, Stabler asks Benson if she saw Marsden, She tells him yes, and that it was a mistake. Cragen then informs them that the rapist's van was found. Benson and Stabler go to the scene of the van, where they find out that there is a soda can with prints on it. That leads them to find the rapists, who turn out to be two brothers.Now that they have the rapists, Benson and Stabler go to the victim, Ronnie's, house. Ronnie tells them once again that he is not testifying. He is mad because he might have HIV and he is getting married in two weeks.Back at the precinct, Cragen scolds the squad. He tells them that they don't have a case. Benson starts to tell him that if the victim won't talk, they won't have a case. Cragen tells Benson that it is her job to make the victims talk -- a job she used to be able to do. Stabler defends Benson by asking Cragen if he has a problem with them. He tells them that he listened to the radio tapes and is upset with them. Tutuola then walks in and gets scolded by Cragen. He tells him he had been talking to a CO at Attica, and he found out that their perp, Bobby Trapedo, belonged to a prison gang. They owned him. Cregan tells Tutuola and Munch to get the cons on tape.Elliot is next seen talking to the psyciatrist again, where she asks him how far his loyalty to Olivia goes. He tells her that once, he chose to save Olivia and a boy died. The pysciatrist asked what Benson would do, and he tells her that she would have to ask her.As Benson is opening the door to her apartment, she is stopped by Marsden. He tells her that he followed her from the precinct, which makes her think that maybe he was stalking the women. He shows her a picture of herself from the newspaper when she was in high school, and he tells her that he found it in his father's things. He then shows her a picture of his father, and Benson tells him that his father raped her mother. Marsden denies it at first, but Benson explains that rapists often lead double lives. She tells him that she found him by chance, and that she's not connected to the cops that are watching him. He denies that he ever did anything, and he could never hurt a woman. She brings up that he once stole women's clothing when he was a kid, and he tells her that it was for his girlfriend.As they are sitting on Benson's couch, he gets to know her. He asks her her preference in ice cream, cereal, and movies. Benson says that her mother is dead and that she is pretty much on her own.In the middle of the night, Benson is called to a crime scene by Millfield. One of the women that Marsden was supposidly stalking was raped, and Benson tells Millfeild that it is impossible that Marsden had done it, because he had been at the apartment.At the station house, the victim identifies Marsden. Benson then doubts that Marsden was ever telling the truth.Back at the precinct, Cragen questions Benson's relationship to Marsden. Benson informs him that Marsden is her brother. He then questions Stabler's involvment in her search for Marsden, but neither Benson nor Stabler tell the truth. This makes Cragen angry, and orders them to go home. Munch informs Cragen that they found tapes from Bobby Trapedo's fellow inmates, stating that he was raped in prison. Novak and Huang threaten to use the tapes to send into Dateline, causing Trapedo to confess to raping the men. Benson is next seen talking to the pyschiatrist again, who asks her if she would choose Elliot over a member of the public. Upset with the questioning, Benson leaves.Stabler shows up at Bensons apartment offering her company. While there, he discovers that Millfield's sister went to school with Marsden. They then question Marsden to find out if he had any connection to Millfield's sister. In high school, he dated her. The date went too far, and Millfield's sister accused him of causing her great emotional pain. Marsden denies causing any pain to her, but Benson doesn't believe him. He then tells her that he could never lie to his big sister.Benson and Stabler go meet Millfield, where they tell her that they discovered the connection between her and Marsden. Millfield denies knowing that Marsden was the same man that dated her sister in high school, but neither Benson or Stabler believes it.Later, Stabler gets a message that Marsden had jumped bail. He questions Benson to see if she knew anything about it, which offends her. She informs him that she would never interfere with an investigation. Cragen informs Benson and Stabler that they will have to go through a psychiatric examination to see if they are fit to work together. Both are unhappy with it, but know that they are forced to. As a result of the psyciatric exam, Rebecca Hendrix, the psyciatrist, informs Cragen that Benson and Stabler have a mutual reliance and an emotional dependence for eachother, but splitting them up would just cause SVU to lose their two best detectives."

When it appeared the girl may have been sexually assaulted, SVU is brought in. Warner tells Stabler that the girl was not assaulted and that the girl did because she was drinking and vomitted and died from suffocating on her on vomit.  Stabler and Benson interview the couple who tell them that they don't have any liquor because the husband is a recovering alcoholic. They then ask if anyone has a key to their residence. They say that prior to leaving on their vacation they hired a dog walker to come in a couple of times a week to take care of their dog. But they discover that their was not taken cared of. Stabler and Benson go to the walker who tells them that because she has so many clients she passes some of them to high school students and the one she passed the couple to was a girl named Becca Rice. When they go to speak to her, at first she says she doesn't know who the girl is. But when mother comes home, who tells her to tell them what she knows. She says that she gave the key to the place to a girl at her school Regan Michaels. Also there is another student from her school Jordan Owens, whom she tutors who reveals that he was at the party but doesn't know the girl. He then shows them the website that tells people of the party. They see on the website the dead girl and learn her name is Melanie Tamkin. They go to her parents who tell them that she is not a drinker. Later the detectives go speak to Regan and two other students, Mark and Luke who were the hosts of the party. They say that Melanie came and tried to drink but passed out. They tried to wake her up but couldn't. When they tell Novak, she wants to hold them responsible for Melanie's death and find out how they got the liquor. When they are arraigned, Judge Donnelly decides to let them go on their own recognizance but orders them not to drink. Mr. Tamkin who was there gets upset and Stabler takes him and begs Elliot for his help. Later Stabler is having a meal with his daughter when he discovers that she is still drinking. He then asks for her to find Regan and the others when they announce they are having another party. Eventually he goes to see Becca who tells them where they are. They arrest them, Regan, Luke, Matt, and Jordan. Stabler and Novak storm into Donnelly's chambers upon learning that she let them go again. It's after Elliot lets out on Donnelly that she retorts with his interceding for his daughter when she was arrested for a DUI. That's when he gets a call and tells Donnelly that she has to see something and that is the four of them on a blog being drunk and insulting Donnelly who orders them picked up.

Porter then tells her to call him if she hears from him. And he tells her that the camera was broken. Before she asks who turned her to him. While he doesn't come out and say it, he implies that it's Captain Millfield.Olivia then goes to see Millfield to tell her to leave her alone. But it seems that Millfield is determined to get Simon. Later Olivia returns to the squad room and Elliot tells her that the suspect they were interrogating wants to speak only to her. When she goes into the inteerrogation room. The guy provokes her saying that she is just looking to get back at someone who wronged her. That's when she loses and starts beating him. Cragen comes in and pulls her out. He berates her for her actions and she retorts and leaves. Elliot tries to talk to her but she doesn't want to talk.Later Olivia gets a call from Simon who asks her to meet him. She calls Porter who accompanies her. When she meets Simon he is hoping that she will help him but she doubts that he is innocent. When Porter tries to get he runs away and they chase. When he runs into an alley and they follow him, a car comes out and nearly runs it over. And Olivia says it's Simon's car. They go baco to Olivia's and look at some the things Simon gave her, which includes photos of her that their kept. While looking through they find Simon's old address. They arrive hoping to speak to his mom, Sharon but are told by the nurse at the door that she suffers from Alzheimers. She also tells them that Simon did visit her but will most likely not know anything. They go in and speak to her. She recognizes Olivia from the pictures that her husband Joe had of her. She asks what Joe said about her, did he try to contact her. She tells her that he tried to call her but her mother answered and hanged up. When they ask where Simon is, she tells him that he is on Florida on Route 94, Joe left Simon his house there. When they try to talk to her some more her condition surfaces so they leave. Porter says he'll try and find the house, Olivia says to go without she has something to do. Olivia goes to the coroners office and tries to learn about her father. She learns that his name is Hollister and that he died after taking a combination fo drugs and alcohol which was ruled a suicide. She then goes to where he worked, a food distributor. The son of the owner talks to her and tells him that Joe suffered from depression and his father made Joe go see a doctor who medicated. Eventually he met and married Sharon and had Simon. But things changed when he started drinking and when Simon was almost killed because of it Sharon left him and reverted to her maiden name, Marsden and she wouldn't let him see Simon. So it was because he lost Simon that he killed himself. Olivia asks why his father kept him despite his problems. He tells her that most of their biggest clients were because of Joe. When he tells her that among them were Colleges, she asks if one of them was Columbia. Her mother was working in the cafeteria at the time and it was where she was raped. She goes to Huang to talk about it. She tells him that she did research on other rapes committed at the same time and found 2, wherein the victims were also working in cafeterias at colleges at the time and the mo is the same. Olivia wonders what made him stop. Huang tells her that his employer made him see a doctor for his depression which was when the rapes stopped. Olivia tells him rapists don't just stop. Huang tells her that the medication he was prescribed for his depression killed his sex drive and that his depression is what made him rape to begin with. But Huang deduces that there is more. She shows him the photos he kept of her and wonders if her mother was really raped. Huang tells her she has to face what her father was. She then goes to one of the victims who tells her that Joe did rape her. Olivia is going into her apartment when Milliken shows up. She wants Olivia to tell her what she knows. They go to her office and Olivia tells her about what Simon's mother said. When Millfield's calls her she leaves Olivia alone who sees the file on Donna Leonte, the woman Simon supposedly raped. Olivia takes a photo of the hair found on her that supposedly belongs to Simon. When Millfield returns Olivia pretends to get a phone call and leaves. She calls Halloran to meet her in the lab and shows him the photo of the hair that was supposedly pulled by victim of her attacker. Halloran tells her that the hair in the photo was pulled but rather one that fell on it's own. Which means that it was planted. Olivia goes back to talk to Millfield but is told she is on breavement leave because her sister whom Millfield claims was also raped by Simon died a few days ago of a drug overdose.Olivia leaves the station and finds Elliot and Porter waiting for her. Elliot tells her Halloran told him about what she asked and deduced where she is. She asks Porter if he found Simon. He tells her that it was red herring. But Olivia believes that Sharon knew what she was talking about. When they mention Route 94 in Florida; Elliot thinks she was mixed up that she probably meant Route 94 to Florida which is a road sign in the Catskills. Olivia realizes that it is near where Simon use to live and Millfield knows it. She also tells them that Millfield framed Simon. Porter tries to find the house. When they get there, they see the car that nearly ran them over when they were chaisng Simon. They approach the house when they hear a shot. Olivia and Porter enter while Elliot goes around. They enter and find Millfield on the floor and Simon holding a gun on her. Olivia tries to talk to him but he doesn't trust her. When the local police and FBI arrive, Olivia calls Elliot on her cell and leaves it open so they can hear them. Olivia tells Millfield she knows she framed Simon. Millfield claims Simon tried to kill her but Simon says it was an accident. She came in with her gun trained on him and he grabbbed it and it went off. Simon still refuses to surrender and when he hears Porter freaks out. He orders Porter to leave and Olivia to come in unarmed. Which she does. When they hear the conversation and Elliot thinks it's getting shaky decides to go in. Olivia asks him why did he try to run her over with his car. Simon says his car is in the shop. The car outside was driven by Millfield. Olivia says it was Millfield who tried to run her over. She was trying to get Olivia to see that Simon's sum. When Elliot goes in Olivia stands between him and Simon. Simon accuses Millfield of trying to ruin his life and Millfield retorts that he ruined her sister's. Simon denies what she is accusing him of. Olivia asks him to describe the night he was with Millfield's sister. Whe he says he just kissed her then she freaked. Olivia says that she was reliving a traumatic experience. She then asks Millfield if her sister ever spoke about being molested. At first she denies it but later admits she did say something once but didn't believe her. Because she was accusing her father who didn't touch her. But Olivia tells her that sometimes that's what happens they pick one. And Millfield continues blames herself for her sister, saying if she only believed her. Olivia says the only one who is at fault is her father. Millfield admits that Simon's shooting her was an accident. Olivia asks her about Donna Leonte saying that Simon raped her. She convinced her to say Simon raped her. Simon then hands the gun to Olivia and go out. Millfield is taken away in an ambulance and they're told she will be okay. Olivia asks the FBI Agent if he will charge Simon and says after the mess Millfield made, he doesn't need the hassle. Porter takes Simon to his office to get his statement. And before leaving Simon apoogizes to Olivia who does the same. And Olivia thanks Elliot for being there.

Fin and Munch go to the apartment and find that some sprayed rapist on the door. The landlord tells them where he works. Stabler and Benson go to speak to him and he denies their allegations. They go to the woman who spray painted his door who tells them that her son is missing and suspects that he had something to do with it. They take her to identify the body and she says it's her son. Cragen was about to send someone to arrest the guy when a young man comes in saying he has video of the boy who was killed. Cragen, Stabler, and Benson watch the tape while Munch and Fin interview the boy, Scott Heston. Cragen and Stabler deduce that they were staging a fight so that they could put it on the internet but things went out of control when the boy who was killed, Riley was struck in his vital artery. Stabler goes into the interview room and listens as Scott says that the other guy was someone he never knew who knew Riley. But Stabler tells him that when Riley was fighting the other guy the camera was still which meant no one was holding it. So that means  Scott was the other guy. Scott is brought to trial and the defense tries to put on a defense claiming that Scott was acting out over his depression. After the trial while the jury is deliberating, a girl, Cassandra Sullivan approaches Casey telling her that she is Riley's girlfriend and that Scott had some kind of obsession for her.

She explains that she had too much time on her hands before asking if Cragen is there. He tells her she needs to catch him while she can. After giving him a confused look, she approaches Cragen's door.As she watches him pack a box of personal items from his desk, Benson thanks Cragen for pulling the strings he had to for the Brass to allow her to stay at SVU after her suspension hoping it did not cost him too much. Cragen explains he has been temporarily reassigned to the Chief of Detectives office because he failed to supervise: (1) her while she aided her fugitive brother, (2) Stabler while he covered up Kathleen's DUI, and (3) Tutuola while his step-son got away with a double murder.When they join Tutuola, Munch, and Stabler in the bullpen, Stabler informs her the Brass put Munch in charge. Munch tells them he will not do it. Tutuola calls his bluff stating that Munch had taken the Sergeant's Exam without telling anyone. Munch claims he took the exam on a bar bet. Cragen drops the keys to the office on Munch's desk with a warning not to let the power go to his head. When he turns to leave, Lake comments on serving under Cragen and is reminded that Cragen is not dead yet. Stabler assures Cragen they will get him back. Cragen asks that they all try to behave themselves. Before they can spend too much time sulking, Dr. Anna Young arrives to report a possible case of child abuse. As Benson shows her to a seat on her side of the desk, Stabler gets up from his chair telling Sgt. Munch that they have it. Dr. Young explains she is Janis Donovan's psychiatrist. Janis called her while giving her daughter April a bath stating that she scrubbed as hard as she could and still could not get ""the filthy slut clean."" She gives them Janis's address and her card with a request to call her when they know something.At Janis's apartment, Benson and Stabler search for Janis and April. Benson finds an empty crib, but Stabler finds a doll face down in a tub of water. Janis's neighbor Bev, carrying her son, interrupts their search to find out what is going on. After they introduce themselves, Bev explains Janis moved in after her son was born, but she does not do play dates. Benson finds a picture of Dr. Young and April. Bev informs her the woman in the picture is Janis, not Dr. Young.In the squad room on a speaker phone with them, Munch, Lake, and Tutuola inform Benson and Stabler the woman's license is issued to Janis Donovan. When Munch tries to claim he knew something was not right about her, Tutuola asks if superpowers came with his promotion. Munch explains ""Anna"" came from ""Anna Freud"" and ""Young"" came from ""Carl Young"". Lake notes that according to Janis's license, she does not wear glasses. Benson wonders why Janis sent them directly to her apartment. Munch dismisses it as Janis trying to get their attention and tries to close the case, but Benson reminds him about April. Stabler warns Munch they are searching the apartment, but Munch tells him not to without a warrant. Stabler reminds him there is no sign of foul play so they would not be able to get a warrant. Benson believes the fact Janis reporting herself should be enough probable cause to allow them to search the apartment. As Benson explains the only thing the neighbors know about Janis is that she is painfully shy, she remembers Janis gave her a business card. When she asks them to check it, the apartment phone rings. Lake runs the address off of the card and locates Dr. Henry Carlisle, a psychoanalyst.When Benson and Stabler ask Dr. Carlisle if Janis is a patient, he verifies it by claiming doctor-patient privilege. They explain they fear for the safety of April asking for his help in finding her. He does not feel she is a danger to herself or others so he cannot talk. Benson tells him Dr. Young told them he is treating Janis for post-partum depression. Stabler points out Janis was wearing glasses like Carlisle's when she came to the office. Carlisle dismisses her visit to their office claiming it does not make her violent. When Stabler asks about scrubbing April raw and calling her a ""filthy slut"", Dr. Carlisle states, ""That's not good."" Benson threatens him if the baby is harmed and he does not help them. He tells them she works at a museum and he has an emergency contact of Penny Taylor.Penny informs Benson and Stabler that she was fired for unknown reasons and Janis made sure she would never get another babysitting job. Janis would drop April off at 8 and was suppose to return by 6 to pick her up, but would not show until 10 and claim she was on time and Penny was trying to play tricks on her. When Benson asks if she thinks Janis would hurt April, Penny explains Janis threw April's bottle at her when April spit up and claimed Penny fed her hot sauce.In the squad room, Tutuola is informed April's most recent babysitter never heard Janis raise her voice in the 3 weeks she had been working for her. She does not know why Janis did not show up with April that morning, but she called to check on her. A Russian woman named Petra answered claiming Janis was not there. The only place she thinks Janis would be is at work at the Museum of Natural History.At the Museum of Natural History, Benson and Stabler are informed that Janis is an arachnologist. She keeps to herself. When Benson asks about Janis's absence from work, they are told she milks spiders for the venom so she is out in the field looking for more spiders. When the explanation begins on how and why spiders are milked, Benson interrupts stating they just need to find Janis. They are given a list of Janis's hot spots.At the Prince of Peace Church, Benson and Stabler are told Janis has been coming once a week since Reverend Ferguson returned from a trip to Africa where the spiders had gotten into his suitcase. She was there the day prior. When they ask if she knows where Janis is, they are told Janis had a heated discussion with herself about it. One side stating she was running away from home and the other trying to talk her out of it. Benson excuses herself to answer her cell while Stabler is told Janis sounded like she was possessed, but she was sane when she was last seen. Benson informs Stabler Munch was on the phone to tell them Janis's car has Lojack and is heading north on the Westside Highway.When Lake and Tutuola locate the car at Inwood Hill Park, Tutuola informs Sgt. Munch. Lake notices a woman with a hoodie covering her face walking with a stroller, but Tutuola approaches her and finds it is not her. He asks Benson and Stabler if they found anything inside the park. While Benson tells him they have not, Stabler locates a cave for them to search. Inside the cave, they find several jars containing spiders sitting beside a lantern proving she has been there. As they make their way in a little farther, they see Janis sitting on the ground and a car seat close by her. Benson has her put her hands up while Stabler checks the empty car seat. After Benson asks Janis about the baby, she is told her name is not Janis and she is not big enough to have a baby.In the interrogation room, Stabler informs Janis she is not going home until she tells them April's current location. Janis claims she is 6-year-old Tammy. Benson tries to remind her if April is outside she is probably hungry, cold, and scared so she needs to Janis's help to find her. She agrees to help, but is scared Burt will hurt her if she tells, but Benson assures her she will not let anyone hurt her. Once she feels safe, she tells them Burt took April, but she does not know where. Stabler has had enough and shows her the picture of Janis and April. He believes she could not handle motherhood so she abandoned her leaving her to die, but adds if she dies Janis will go to prison for murder. Janis gets angry and slaps Stabler. Stabler reminds her she is suppose to be 6, but she does not slap like one. He holds her from the front while Benson holds her hands behind her back. Janis tells him to get out of her face and demands a lawyer in a Russian accent. As they cuff her, Stabler informs her she is being charged with assaulting a police officer. Janis tells him to grow some balls if he cannot take a slap.Watching the scene play out, Tutuola informs Munch the Russian must be Petra, the lady that answered the babysitter's phone call. Munch tells him he has to get Benson and Stabler out of the room and get Janis a lawyer. Tutuola offers to call Huang to bring the butterfly net.In the squad room, Huang believes Janis has Dissociative Identity Disorder, or multiple personalities. Stabler does not believe in the disorder. Huang informs them psychiatrists cannot agree on its existence. He believes it is over diagnosed, but the cases he has seen are the result of prolonged child sexual abuse. Stabler tells him they do not know if she was abused, but wonders if it will help find April. Huang thinks it may so he needs to know about the alternate personalities. Benson tells him they have seen a shrink, a little girl, and a tough Russian. Stabler believes she is acting. Huang explains that when a child is being repeatedly abused she can escape and believe it is happening to someone else. The personalities are formed as needed to help deal with the trauma. Stabler wants him to trick Janis into telling them where April is, but Huang explains the host personality rarely knows about the alternates or their actions. Benson tells him Tammy was about to tell her where Burt took April when Petra showed up and slapped Stabler. Stabler adds he would like 5 minutes with Burt and asks how to get to him. Huang informs them the alternates are brought out with stress so they need to find the right trigger. Munch shows up dressed in uniform stating a press conference is their last option, but Stabler corrects him stating Huang has an idea to get her to talk. Huang wants to hypnotize her, but Munch tells him he cannot talk to her. Stabler informs Munch that he is not taking orders from him even if they crown him Chief of Detectives. Munch explains they cannot talk to Janis because her lawyer is already there. Benson reminds him they can talk to the lawyer. As they walk away, Munch tells them to tune it at 11 because everyone that has ever seen April will be calling.When Benson returns to the Interrogation Room, Heshy Horowitz is advising Janis to reconsider discontinuing his service. Janis asks Benson to identify herself. After she does, Janis introduces herself as Dori and asks that she tell Horowitz that she does not need him because she did nothing wrong. Benson believes she has changed her mind, but Horowitz does not believe she is competent. When Janis tries to fire him, Horowitz explains that since she invoked her right to counsel he is her lawyer until she legally waives the right.  Benson excuses herself to obtain the proper form, Huang, and Stabler in the next room. When she signs it ""Dori Johnson,"" Horowitz tells her that she signed it with the wrong name. She insists it is her name. Stabler leans in and tells her if she wants to get rid of the lawyer she has to sign the form ""Janis Donovan"" before he winks at her. She willingly signs it. When Stabler shows Horowitz the form, he tells Janis to call him when she changes one of her minds. When Huang introduces himself, she tells him she already has a shrink before turning to ask Stabler where his gun is. Stabler tells her it is in his locker. She asks to see it, but he wants to know where April is first. She tells him that if she knew she would tell him. She turns her attention to Huang to inform him she does not know why she is in therapy. She has been hypnotized, but refuses to allow him to do so for fear that Dr. Carlisle will not like it. Stabler tries to get her to do it for him, but she refuses saying she does not want to go away because she feels safe here. Huang tells Benson to get her shrink here while he keeps trying because he would know how to reach Burt.As Benson escorts Dr. Carlisle to Janis, he claims Janis's alters are not violent. She tells him Petra slapped Stabler, but he thinks Janis felt extremely threatened since Petra is her protector. Tutuola interrupts them stating he hopes April is not out in the storm because they have come up empty. Lake informs her the choppers used infrared on the park and they have not found anything. Benson informs them they are still working on Janis and asks them to catch Munch.Tutuola and Lake join Novak in the squad room to view Munch's press conference. Munch informs the press they are looking for a one-year-old that was last seen with her mother Janis Donovan. He announces a $10,000 reward for information and asks they call a hotline number to Special Victims. While he is talking, Lake comments that he looks good earning himself a dirty look from Tutuola. As soon as Munch finishes talking, the phones start ringing. Tutuola answers the first one only to have to explain April is Caucasian. Novak announces ""The circus begins.""In the Interrogation Room, Dr. Carlisle has hypnotized Janis with Benson and Stabler observing through the window. Dr. Carlisle raises her hand and tells her when he taps her shoulder she will be wide awake, refreshed, and perfectly calm. Janis tells him April is at the babysitters, but she does not remember taking her there. She remembers giving April a bath and then searching the cave for spiders. Stabler thinks Janis killed April. Dr. Carlisle has Janis allow them to talk to Burt. When he comes through, Janis picks up the chair and throws it at the window causing Huang to call for assistance. While Benson and Stabler cuff her, Burt tells them they will never see April again. Dr. Carlisle touches her shoulder bringing Janis back trying to figure out what is going on.In the squad room, Lake informs everyone a gas station attendant outside Philly saw Janis with April using cash that morning. Tutuola tells them a waitress at an IHOP in Reno is serving her pancakes now. Stabler tells Lake to have Philly follow up with the gas station attendant since Janis worked at Penn last year. When Munch arrives, Benson informs him Dr. Carlisle has had Janis bouncing around personalities for hours and Burt is not talking. They are interrupted when Cass Magnall walks in informing them April is fine and has been with her all day. She adds she is April's mother.In the interview room, Cass informs Lake and Stabler that she is Janis's sister. Janis had been watching April for her. They do not understand why no one knew Janis was not April's real mother or that she had a sister. Cass explains Janis moved there after April was born and she had went to prison.In the interrogation room, Janis tells Benson that she does not have a sister. When she mentions she believes it would have come up during therapy, Benson realizes she is talking to Dr. Young. When Benson tells her she needs to talk to Janis, she is told she does not know where she is.In the interview room, Cass asks to speak with Janis so she can vouch for who she is. Stabler doubts that considering Janis does not even know who she is herself. When she claims she does not know what is wrong with Janis considering she was fine that morning, Stabler asks about her incarceration. She admits she bought heroin from a narc when she was 8 months pregnant and got out the day prior. Lake implies the reward would come in handy right now causing Cass suggests he call her landlady to verify April is with her.Munch joins Benson and Janis in the interrogation room with a copy of Janis's license. After briefly searching for her glasses, she states it looks like Janis's driver's license. Benson asks her to step around the table to the mirror and asks who is there. Janis admits it is Benson and Janis, but believes they are playing tricks instead of allowing her image in the mirror. When that does not work, Munch shows her a picture of Cass. She denies knowing who it is causing him to suggest a stroll down memory lane.Stabler asks Cass if there is any truth to Huang's thought that Janis was abused as a child. Cass grabs her purse and holds it while claiming not to know anything about Janis's abuse. Janis left home when Cass was 6. She admits being abused, but denies telling Janis because she was not there to protect her. The night Janis left, her father pulled her around the house by her hair wanting to know where Janis went. When she did not know, he forced her to drink hot sauce until she threw up. Her mother was in the room watching, but did not say a word, even when he began raping her. She begged her mother to help her, but no one ever did. While watching from the window in Cragen's office, Janis tells Munch to turn off the speaker. He does and pulls the blinds. She questions how Janis could do something like that when she knew it would happen. She claims it happened to Janis stating she would never have left Cass because she would have told someone. Munch offers to get her a tissue leaving her alone.As Munch gets the tissue, Benson informs him Tutuola just called stating April was where Cass said safe and sound. Munch realizes his press conference was unnecessary so he announces the calls are no longer needed. Munch tells Benson to ask Carlisle what to do about Janis.Upon returning to the office, Munch catches Janis looking at a file. She claims she was trying to figure out where she was. Benson realizes they are talking to Janis and introduces herself again. Janis believes she is there collecting specimens. When Munch tries to correct her she points out he has a ""Daddy Long Legs"" on his file cabinet. He comments on Cragen leaving him 3 months of paperwork and spiders. Janis takes the opportunity to inform him that he is never more than 6 feet from a spider. Cass interrupts them stating they need to talk. When Cass asks if she can take Janis home, Benson informs her that she needs to check with someone first.Upstairs, Huang tells Dr. Carlisle that sending Janis home is a crap shoot. Dr. Carlisle believes she had an extremely stressful day and is not violent. When Benson reminds him he has been treating her 5 personalities for a year, Carlisle informs her they are all functional so they have no grounds to commit her. He believes she is on the road to recovery, especially since she is developing a relationship with her sister. He believes Cass can help her face the abuse and integrate her personalities. He tells them to let Janis go home with Cass.At the Stabler residence, Kathleen comes into her parents' bedroom yelling for Stabler while he is trying to sleep. When he asks her what time it is, she calls him lazy before telling him it is 9. Carrying a basket of laundry into the room, Kathy urges her to let Stabler sleep since he worked all night. Stabler notices the basket and tells her he will take care of it since she should not be lifting things. Kathleen states she should not be pregnant because she is too old and people will think it is hers. Returning to the task at hand, she informs Stabler her classmates saw her picking up trash in her orange vest. He reminds her she cannot go against the judge's orders. Kathy reminds her she could have gotten jail time. Kathleen insists she is not trying to get out of the punishment, she just wants it moved indoors so no one will see her. She is interrupted by his cell phone.Benson and Stabler arrive at the Donovan residence to Warner wondering why they were called since there is no evidence of a sex crime. Francis and Molly Donovan are the victims. They explain they met their daughters the day before. Both victims were shot in the chest and the murder weapon was left. Stabler notes Molly was killed in her sleep, but Francis woke up to see the killer before being killed. Warner informs them they have a bloody fingerprint on the door. Benson informs her the perp is Janis Donovan before telling Stabler they should have had Janis committed. They are interrupted by Stabler's phone ringing. He tells Kathy it is not a good time, but she tells him Janis is at their house with a knife. He tells her to get out of the house.At the Stabler residence, a uniform officer tells Stabler Kathy is still inside adding Dori insisted on speaking with both of them. Looking through the window, he sees Dori sitting in his living room holding a knife across from Kathy.Janis tells Kathy that it was love at first sight for she and Stabler. He knelt down, whispered to her, and winked. There was electricity. She pauses when Stabler enters. Kathy calmly greets him stating ""Dori"" was just talking about him. Stabler asks ""Dori"" what is going on. She tells him she wanted to see him again. Kathy tells him ""Dori"" was upset and wanted to hurt herself. When ""Dori"" tries to verify Kathy is his wife, Stabler asks how she found out where he lives. ""Dori"" explains she read his file when Munch left her alone in the office. Stabler calmly tells Kathy to leave. She tells ""Dori"" to take care of herself before telling Stabler to do the same and leaving. ""Dori"" comments on Kathy's weight. He tells her to put the knife down on the coffee table, but she stands up wondering why he wants it. He tells her he does not want her to hurt herself as Benson sneaks up behind her. She claims she needs it in case Burt comes after her. He assures her he will protect her, but she does not believe him. When she explains he killed Janis's parents, Benson grabs her from behind. While ""Dori"" screams for Stabler saying Burt has her, Benson and Stabler disarm her safely.At Grellman Psychiatric Hospital, Benson informs Novak she does not believe Janis is competent to stand trial. Novak reminds her that Janis confessed to killing her parents in cold blood. Stabler reminds her that Burt is the one that killed her parents. Benson adds that Dori was the one that flipped on Burt. Novak reminds them they are all the same person and she does not care how many names she goes by she is putting her body in jail. When Dr. Carlisle joins them, Benson comments on how bumpy her road to recovery got. He admits he should have spent more time drawing out Burt, but he did not believe any of her personalities were violent. He does not believe her psyche could handle a trial right now because he has never had to medicate her to bring her back. Novak does not have confidence in his professional opinion so she is ordering a 7-30 exam.In the squad room, Lake tells Tutuola that even though he saw crazies in Brooklyn, but Manhattan SVU is a cuckoo magnet. Tutuola tells him he should have been there for the case when the white supremacist shot Munch adding he still has to sit on a special pillow. Lake draws attention to Cragen approaching with his box. He verifies he is back stating it helped when Sgt. Munch released a maniac that promptly killed her parents. Tutuola informs him the judge ruled she was competent to stand trial.When Cragen enters his office he asks Munch if he missed him. Munch tells him he is glad he is back adding he does not want the job. Cragen happily informs him he is relieved of his CO duties. Munch updates him stating Stabler and Benson searched the Donovan residence and found photos confirming the abuse. Nova tried to plead her out since the jury would have sympathy on her, but Janis refused claiming she is innocent. Cragen states it is up to whatever bogus defense her lawyer can dream up.Horowitz tells The judge that Janis was not at the scene of the crime. Novak disputes this stating her bloody fingerprint was found at the scene. Horowitz clarifies that her body was there, but her mind was not. He explains that she suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and has 5 documented identities. She cannot be held responsible for what her alters did. The judge asks if they should swear in each identity separately. Novak argues they cannot take Janis at her word that she did not know what was going on because then everyone would claim their imaginary friend did things. Horowitz reminds them in US v. Denny-Shaffer, the Appeals Court tore the trial court a new one for not allowing the defense. The judge grants Horowitz's motion.In court, Horowitz has Dr. Carlisle testify to the fact he diagnosed Janis with DID 11 months before the crime and at no time did she know about the alters. Dr. Carlisle claims that when an alter is present, Janis is nonexistent. He claims he brought them out in deep hypnosis, which he had a vested interest in for a book he is writing. He claims the book is because of Janis and not the other way around. The only proof he has that the alters exist is that they have different voices, handwriting, and behavior. Novak claims that since the alters were created to protect Janis then they would lie to protect her for this. Novak wonders what was different that night than over the year he had been treating Janis without any signs of violence. Cass informs Novak that she told Janis about her abuse that night. Janis got a blank look on her face then left. Cass tried calling her name, but she did not respond. Janis claims she does not know Burt. She claims she did not kill her parents. Novak asks what is the last thing she remembers from the night her parents were murdered. She remembers talking to her sister that night, then waking up in the hospital. When she claims it is horrible missing chunks of time, Novak shows her the shotgun used to kill her parents with her fingerprints on it. Janis claims she remembers the gun from her childhood. When she denies remembering shooting her parents, Novak shows her the picture of their bodies lying in bed. When Novak gets in her face, Janis jumps up grabbing her by the throat saying ""leave her alone"" repeatedly causing The judge to call the court officers to get her out of there.Novak arrives at the squad room to Stabler reading the New York Ledger with the headline ""DA FLOPS KILLER WALKS"". She tells him that is one for her scrapbook. Stabler reminds her that it was not an acquittal. Novak adds that she is only in there until she convinces them she is sane. Novak notices a book in the picture as the same one she read while preparing for the case. Using a magnifying glass, she sees the book is from when Cass was in jail deducing Cass was helping Janis with her defense while she was still in jail.Benson and Stabler speak with an ex-cell mate of Cass's at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility about the book. She tells them Janis faked the whole thing and she cannot believe the courts fell for it. Cass allowed her to read all of her letters where they planned the entire thing. She adds Cass read the book Cybil like it was the Bible.At Grellman, Benson and Stabler interrupt Cass's visit with Janis to congratulate her on her performance portraying Tammy, Dr. Young, Petra, Stabler's favorite Dori, and the unforgettable Burt. When she claims she does not know what they are talking about, they inform her their techs were able to restore the research she did on her computer on multiple personalities.  She admits she was good catching them in her web. She feels she is integrated now and can be released soon. When Cass tries to shut her up, Janis reminds her double jeopardy prohibits them from coming after her again. Stabler agrees with her before placing Cass under arrest for the murders. Janis tells them she was not there, but they inform her that since they planned it together they might as well have pulled the trigger together. Janis tries blaming the abuse stating they will never recover from it. They ignore her and leave as she yells to Cass that she is suffering from Better Child Syndrome and it is not her fault."

She struggles with her attacker, they fall out of the bed with her on top, she smashes him in the head with a glass and runs to another room.  She blocks the door with a cabinet, finds a phone, and calls 911.  As the operator assures her that the police are on their way, the attacker is heard pounding on the door and shouting for her to open it and the girl is leaning against the cabinet struggling to keep the door shut.  As the scene closes, the 911 operator asks if the attacker is still in the apartment and she replies, ""Yes. He's my sister's boyfriend.""At the scene, Benson and Stabler take the girl's statement.  Christie McGarrett describes a fairly normal evening where she and her sister, Rachael, and Rachel's boyfriend, Dan, had dinner, talked for a while, and went to bed around ten.  Rachel and Dan took the bedroom, and Christie slept on the couch.  Then Christie woke up with Dan on top of her.  Christie pleads with them to let her speak to her sister, but before they can respond, a CSU tech interrupts and insists that they come with her immediately.Leading them to the bedroom, she says, ""Rachel's gone.""  Benson asks, ""Where?  You don't usually go for a walk after your sister's been raped.""  There is blood spatter on the bed and on the floor by the window, and there are no fingerprints to be found leading to the conclusion that she has been abducted.  Looking at a photograph of a happy young couple on a tropical beach, Elliot suggests that they talk to the boyfriend.Dan is in the bathroom having his head wound treated when Benson and Stabler come to question him.  They ask where Rachel is, and he says he doesn't remember.  Stabler asks if the blow to the head gave him amnesia and Benson insists that there's no way he could forget raping his girlfriend's little sister.  Dan acts surprised, and Stabler suggests that a trip to the precinct will help him remember.  He says they wouldn't believe him if he told them what happened and then claims to have assaulted Christie in his sleep.In the interrogation room, Stabler suggests that Dan and Rachel had a fight, Dan killed her and dumped the body, and was trying to kill Christie because she was the only one who could identify him.  Dan insists that he cannot remember what happened and that he has a condition.  Elliot interrupts him saying he has a headache, at which point Dan's lawyer shows up to explain that he suffers from arousal parasomnia, a sleep disorder which causes him to have sex in his sleep.  Dan insists that Rachel knows about it and tells him it's the best sex she's ever had.While Stabler continues talking with Dan, Benson interviews Christie.  Christie tells her she met Dan for the first time the previous day, that she was in town visiting and looking at colleges, and that Rachel said she was in love with Dan.  Christie wonders how Dan could do something like this.  Back in interrogation, Stabler asks Dan why he would rape Christie if Rachel loves his 'sleep sexing' so much.  Dan explains that he must have attacked Christie in his sleep because Rachel wasn't there.  He woke up when Christie cut him with the glass, and when he went to tell Rachel what had happened, she was gone.Dan's lawyer insists that they can't charge Dan with a rape he didn't know he was committing.  In the observation room, Novak confirms the defense attorney's analysis.  Stabler says, ""If it looks like a rape and acts like a rape.""  Novak agrees, ""It is a rape.  Unless the accused isn't conscious of what his body's doing.""  She likens the attack to a sleeping mother who rolls over and kills her baby, her body did it, but her brain didn't know about it.  Benson points out that the sexsomnia still doesn't explain what happened to Rachel, but Huang says that it does.  He explains that a patient with sexsomnia will have sex with whoever is available.  Dan probably had sex with Christie because Rachel was already gone. Benson says it sounds like a cover-up for murdering Rachel and dumping her body.  Novak tells her there has never been a homicide linked to sexsomnia.  Stabler seconds Benson's concerns.  Huang tells him that if Rachel was in love with Dan she probably wouldn't have left on her own and he thinks Rachel was kidnapped.  As they walk through the squad room, Benson asks Christie if Rachel had mentioned any problems with anyone.  Christie says no and that her sister would have told her if there were.  Exiting the squad room, they encounter Dan and Elliot.  Dan tried to explain and says he never meant to hurt her.  Christie screams at him to shut up, nothing he can say will bring Rachel back.  Christie's father appears around the corner, and upon confirming that Dan was the guy who raped his daughter, he tackles him and punches him in the face.  Stabler pulls him off of Dan and as he helps Dan up, Benson explains that they don't think Dan was involved in the kidnapping and they can't arrest him for the rape because he was unaware of his actions.  She assures Mr. McGarrett that they are working around the clock to find Rachel, and he says, ""Good, because so far all you have done is hide behind the law.""In the crime lab, the CSU tech shows Benson DNA results that confirm the blood on the bed and by the window was Dan's.  Benson is encouraged that at least they know Rachel wasn't hurt badly.  Unfortunately, the tech informs her that the kidnapper didn't leave a shred of forensic evidence.  Benson gets a text from Cragen to turn on channel four, and she and the tech tune into a press conference where Mr. McGarrett calls the squad incompetent for not arresting Dan and offers a $50,000 reward for information leading them to Rachel's safe return.  He urges people to call the SVU tip line and the cut to the squad fielding calls.Fin gets a call from a woman who says she saw Rachel in Times Square and wants the reward in small bills.  Cragen complains, ""A reward offer brings out all kinds of crazies.""  Benson grumbles about, ""One bogus lead after the next,"" and sends another detective to check something out.  Lake shouts, ""Maybe not!""  The group gathers round Lake's speaker phone and he asks the caller, Ginger Maxon, to tell them what she just told him.  Ginger says, ""I think Rachel's in another universe.""At Ginger's loft, she explains to Lake and Benson that Another Youniverse (AY) is a virtual reality game that she and Rachel play online all the time.  When Lake asks if that is where she and Rachel met, Ginger says they know each other from art school.  Ginger introduces them to her VR avatar, Tawny Coppercuffs, and soon becomes absorbed in her game as she gives them a quick tour from her online diary.  She shows them a scene where she and Rachel, as her avatar Vixy Platinum, were hanging out at the virtual pool.  Lake comments that the avatars' names sound like a couple of hookers and she explains that they own virtual sex clubs in AY.   Benson is mystified that Rachel and Ginger would choose to be prostitutes, and Ginger explains that it is a fantasy, not a crime, and that it is safe.  They have sex for money with no risk of STDs and they aren't hurting anybody.  Ginger takes them to Rachel/Vixy's club, Vixy Platinum's Underage Wonderstage, and there are numerous male avatars standing around with signs asking ""Where's Vixy?"" shouting ""Vixy, come back.""  Ginger explains that these are Rachel/Vixy's fans.  She performs every day at two, but she skipped her performance today and her fans miss her already.  Benson comments that Vixy looks like a kid while Rachel is in her twenties.  Ginger reminds her that in AY you can be any age you want.  Lake notes that you can also be any age your customers want.  Benson and Lake conclude that virtual sex wasn't enough for one of Vixy's customers, so he kidnapped her.Back in the squad room, Benson and Lake explain AY to Cragen.  He comments that it is ""like an online version of the Wild West,"" and Stabler approaches saying, ""With its own sheriff.""  He hands Cragen a printout about Eric Winton, the game's designer.  Benson realizes that he would have access to all the Avatars' personal information.Benson and Stabler go to AY headquarters and Winton is eager to help them.  She shows them Vixy's club, and all the customers have already moved on.  So he calls up a screen cap from earlier, and then shows them a map of the world that shows her customers' homes all across the globe.  Benson asks how the avatars communicate, and Winton shows Vixy's blog.  The last entry, posted twelve hours before Rachel disappeared, was titled ""Stalker.""  Vixy was afraid that she had a virtual stalker who had started coming after her in the real world, and she warned other women in the game to stay away from a male avatar named Wit Billions, who wears an executioner's mask.  Winton tells them that only one of Vixy's regular customers was not present at the vigil at her club and Benson correctly guesses that it was Wit Billions.  Winton brings up Billions's personal information and it leads them to a New York man named Tobin Willis.Fin and Lake question Willis.  Lake shows him that his name is an anagram for the avatar Wit Billions.  He denies ever playing the game, but Lake shows him the credit card records that seem to prove he is lying.  He insists someone must have stolen his card and opened an account in his name.  Fin says they'll check out his story when the computer techs search his computer.  Meanwhile, Benson and Stabler search Willis's apartment and find numerous books about executioners.  In one of them is an image of a head chopper who looks very much like Wit Billions.  Returning to the interrogation room, Benson shows him the book and tells him, ""Your sick obsession with an avatar made you kidnap its creator last night.  Willis tells them he was at Shea Stadium last night.  The game went into extra innings and it was after midnight until he got home.  He saw himself on the Jumbotron a dozen times.  The alibi checks out, and at the same time, Lake arrives to report that there was nothing on his computer.  Fin thinks he is playing the game from untraceable internet café's.  Cragen thinks he's too smart, and Benson suggests he's working with a partner.  They return to AY headquarters, and Winton helps them locate his partner by searching for all the avatars Wit Billions met with two, then three, and finally four or more times.  Vixy and a male avatar named Smarty Culottes are the only avatars Billions met with four or more times.  Smarty has to be his partner.  Winton accesses Smarty's personal information and it leads to a man named Nestor Buchanan, who works at Cooper's Rare Books, a shop that Lake frequents.  When Benson and Lake arrive at the bookstore, the owner, Julian Cooper offers him an early edition of The Sun Also Rises.  Chester says he isn't interested and flashes his badge, asking for Nestor.  Cooper takes them to the back where they find Nestor, Cooper's assistant, frantically tapping away at the keyboard.  Nestor is so engrossed in what he is doing that he refuses to stop even when Lake identifies himself as a police officer and asks him to stand up.  They have to pull the keyboard away from him.  Benson asks him where Rachel is and he denies knowing her.  Lake sees on the screen that he is playing AY.  Benson asks about Rachel again and Nestor denies knowing her, so she arrests him.When Benson and Fin show Nestor the screen caps from Smarty's encounters with Wit Billions, Nestor says he never knew his real name or location.  Fin takes him into the observation room where he can see Tobin Willis through the glass.  Nestor recognizes him from the bookstore, but says he has never talked to him about AY.  When asked who he did discuss the game with, he mentions, among others, his boss, Julian Cooper.  Fin sends Nestor back into the other interrogation room so that he and Benson can discuss the new information.  They reason that Cooper stole Willis's credit card information from the store's records to set up Wit Billion's account in Willis's name then hung out with Smarty in the game to make it look like Willis and Nestor were working together.  Lake and Benson break into the bookstore to find that the Cooper and the computer are gone but he left a key behind.  The key leads them to a storage unit where they find more books and a typed note reading, ""It's not what you think.  Leave us in peace.""  Benson calls Novak for a warrant to search Cooper's apartment.  She and Lake find that he took the computer from there, too.  The CSU tech says she lifted some latent prints all belonging to cooper and that it doesn't look like a woman was being held there.  Benson spots a photograph on the wall of a young girl who looks just like Vixy Platinum.  On the back of the photograph, they find a to-do list that includes buying medications and transferring $5,000 in AY funds to someone named J.T.  There is a phone number beside the name, so Lake calls J.T. and reaches Jessie Taylor Realty.The realtor tells Benson and Lake that they have no record of doing business with Julian Cooper or Nestor Buchanan, but she did rent a warehouse to Tobin Willis two weeks ago.  They never met because he handled everything on the computer or over the phone and she can't ID his voice because she talks to so many people every day in her work.  He paid the rent by money order six months in advance.  She also remembers, ""He wanted something in a deserted area, like a cabin in the woods.""She lets Benson and Lake into the warehouse where the find Rachel blindfolded, gagged, and tied to a bed, alive but barely breathing.  Benson calls for an ambulance and then helps Lake to until Rachel.  As Lake discovers suitcases and realizes that Cooper was about to move her, he hears an engine start.  He runs after the car but can't get the license number.  When he returns, Olivia tells him the drugs at still there on a tray in the corner.At Mercy General Hospital, Rachel's doctor tells them the drugs could have knocked Rachel out ""or at least kept her semiconscious depending on the combined dosage.""  She allows them five minutes to question Rachel, but she can't identify her kidnapper because he wore a mask.  She remembers being injected in the neck and trying to scream, but he put his hand over her mouth.  She passed out, woke up tied to a bed, and he raped her.  He told her he wanted to take her to a cabin in the woods.Back at the squad room, Benson reports that the rape kit was negative for DNA and there were no prints at the warehouse.  Stabler alerted the authorities to watch for Cooper, and Cragen says he won't get far.  Lake says that ""maybe Gregory Searle will,"" and explains that Cooper's prints matched Searle's and that twenty-five years ago he was convicted of kidnapping a girl in Duchess County.  The girl's name was Lauren Mobley, and she is the girl in the photo they took from Cooper's apartment.  When Benson and Stabler meet with Novak, they learn that Lauren was never found and the Duchess County DA is convinced Cooper/Searle killed her.  They arrested him on kidnapping because they found strands of Lauren's hair in his pickup and he got twenty years with no possibility for parole.  Stabler receives a call that Cooper has been found at a bus terminal in Queens and Fin and Lake are on their way to arrest him.  Cooper is found loading his bags onto the 10:15 bus to Montreal.  They take him into custody and he says he'll be back in time to take the 2:40 bus instead.  Lake says, ""We'll see if you're so cocky after Rachel McGarrett IDs your voice.""  They arrive at the hospital to find Rachel has gone into respiratory arrest and died.  Cooper expresses his sympathies and says he has a bus to catch.  Benson shoves him and the scene cuts to her pushing him into a chair in interrogation.Cooper insists he didn't kill Rachel and Nestor must have.  Nestor had access to the credit card records and he plays the game.  When Stabler presents him with the to-do list found in his apartment, he says Nestor has a key and must have planted it.  He also says Nestor handles the inventory for the book shop and he must have been the one to leave the note at the storage locker.  He doesn't deny kidnapping Lauren Mobley but says he paid his debt to society and changed in prison.  He found solace in books when he took over the prison library.  He changed his name and opened the book store when he got out of prison because he wanted a fresh start.In the observation room, Stabler worries that Cooper is getting away with two murders.  Novak doesn't understand why he kidnapped Rachel when it was Vixy, the avatar, which looked like Lauren, his first victim.  Huang explains that in Cooper's mind, since Rachel created Vixy, raping Lauren was the same as having sex with Vixy.  Benson reasons that Cooper found Rachel by paying a hacker to trace her IP address back to her apartment.  ""Probably's not enough to get a conviction,"" Novak reminds her and since Cooper has been through the system, he knows that.  Stabler says they have to get a confession or he walks.  Huang tells them to use Lauren to get him to talk about Rachel because the two girls are the same in his mind.  Cooper claims he rescued Lauren from an alcoholic mother and an abusive father and that they were in love.  He drove ever other day to see her, and he told her she could leave but she chose to stay with him.  He was arrested the next day.  When Stabler tries to divert the conversation to Rachel, Cooper stops talking and leaves the precinct.  Novak says if they can find Lauren's body they can charge him with her murder and they can use the crimes upstate as precedent in a case for Rachel's kidnapping and murder.  Stabler says they needed the body ""yesterday,"" and Benson realizes the cabin and the location of Lauren's body might be in the game.  Novak says if they use the AY game to find Lauren's body Cooper won't stand a chance in court.  Cragen send Benson back to AY headquarters where she works with Winton to find the cabin and has Stabler tail Cooper until they Lauren's find the body.  They find the cabin in the game, and there is an avatar sleeping on the bed.  A name plate on the headboard reads ""Lauren.""  It is a programmable avatar Cooper bought for his own use in the game.  Winton runs a software program to compare the lake in the game with a topographical map of New York State while Cragen sends Fin and Lake Upstate to search for it.  Elliot confronts Cooper when he stops for a cup of coffee.  Cooper again denies killing either of the girls and says they won't find his cabin in the game.  The software identifies the lake as Twin Island Lake.  Benson notifies Fin who calls ahead to the authorities in Duchess County while Stabler informs them that Cooper is on the Grand Central Parkway.  Fin supposes he is headed for the International Terminal at Kennedy International Airport.They can't find any landmarks in the game to tell them exactly where on the shore of the lake they can find the real cabin because it was designed with a safety catch that makes it disappear when anyone moves up to a bird's eye-view.  Benson wonders if there is another way to determine the cabin's location, and Winton says sunlight.  The game runs on Eastern Standard Time, and when the sun rises they will know which side of the lake the cabin is on.  Benson tells him to turn on the sun, but he is reluctant to do so because it has never been done before in the game.  Fin tells Benson the lake is huge and the Duchess County cops don't know where to start their search.  She urges Winton again to turn on the sun.  Stabler reports that Cooper is arriving at the terminal and, ""It's now or never.""Fretting that he is ""about to seriously freak out five million people,"" Winton turns on the sun.  The sun rises behind the cabin, illuminating the lake.  Benson tells Fin it's on the East shore of the lake.  The scene fades to a real world cabin identical to the one in the game.  A young woman emerges from the cabin pointing a shotgun at Fin and telling him to ""Stop right there.""  He tells her it is Gregory Searle's cabin and asks who she is.  She identifies herself as Lauren and says she has been waiting for Gregory for twenty-five years.  Lake informs Cragen of what they have found.  Stabler asks if it is a joke, and Cragen says no, the case is over.  Without a body they have no excuse to arrest Cooper.  Then Stabler sees Cooper cross against the light and arrests him for it.Benson and Stabler interview Lauren who confirms Cooper's story about her parents and says she didn't come forward at Searle's trial because the authorities would have sent her back to her abusive home.  She got a job waiting tables at a diner in town and waited for Searle's to get out of jail and come back to her.  It was fifty miles from her hometown and no one was looking for her there, so she lived undiscovered all that time.  She doesn't believe Benson and Stabler when they tell her about what Cooper did to Rachel.  When they let her see him, she is overjoyed and crosses the room to embrace him, but he withdraws from her asking, ""What happened to you?  You got so old.""  Her illusions shattered with the revelation that the love of her life is nothing more than a pedophile, Lauren tells him he's sick and asks what he did to Rachel.  He says he rescued her, just like he did Lauren.  Lauren says he kidnapped her because she reminded him of Lauren.  He admits that her avatar did, but Rachel didn't love him.  Lauren says she loved him, but he tells her it was too late, and she slaps him.  Stabler asked Cooper if he planned to keep Rachel chained to a desk playing AY all day, and he said, ""If that's what it took.  She'd never grow up in a computer."""

A taxi driver is talking to his fare, Ben Nicholson, who irritably asks him to be quiet because he's ""really tired.""  The cabbie complains that he's tired too, tired of circling the block and asks why he doesn't just get out.  Nicholson tosses two one hundred dollar bills on the front seat and says he'll tell the cabbie when he's ready to get out.  The cabbie glances down at the money and then back up to the street where, just in time, he sees a young girl come running out into the street dressed in nothing but a blood-soaked nightgown and carrying a phone.    Nicholson screams out her name, ""Katie!"" and bolts from the cab to go to her.  He takes the phone from her and hears a 911 operator asking if the call is a prank.  He responds, ""My daughter is covered in blood.  Does that sound like a prank to you?"" and goes into the building.  Inside his apartment, Nicholson finds his wife on the bedroom floor bleeding profusely from a head wound.  At the hospital, a nurse tells Benson and Stabler that it will be a while before they can talk to the victim, Corinne Nicholson.  Elliot asks her to bag Corrine's clothes and start a rape kit.  From behind him, he hears a child's voice asking, ""What's a rape kit, Dad?""  Elliot turns to see Katie Nicholson come running toward him.  She introduces herself and tells him, ""You look upset and need a hug.  Can I?""  With Olivia looking over his shoulder, he accepts the hug and then looks up at Ben Nicholson who calls his daughter back over to him.  In the squad room, Katie goes from detective to detective chatting with them and asking for hugs.  She tells Munch, ""Some people think I'm an elf.  I'm not, see?"" She shows him her ears and says, ""Only one pointy ear.""  Then she introduces herself and asks for a hug.  Munch refuses and tells her, ""I'm a stranger.  You shouldn't even be talking to me.""  Katie responds cheerfully with, ""Ok, bye,"" and a wave and a smile.  She proceeds to Fin's desk where she plays with his pony tail.  He asks gruffly, ""Is there something I can do for you?""  Katie looks a little hurt and asks if he is mad at her.  Fin says sternly, ""Didn't Sergeant Munch just tell you not to talk to strangers?""  When she nods, he gives her a smile and she grins back, knowing that everything is ok.  In Cragen's office, Olivia explains to the captain the Katie ""has a rare form of mental retardation called Williams Syndrome.""  Elliot explains that they don't know if she can tell them what happened because ""she's ""anxious one minute overly friendly the next.  She seems to have a limited attention span.""  At Cragen's suggestion, they involve Katie's father in getting her statement.    The interview takes place in the children's interview room.  After some encouragement from her dad and reassurance that she ""did all the right things"" from Olivia, she is able to give a detailed account of what happened.    Katie acts out the events as she describes them.  First she says there was shouting that was so loud it made her cover her ears and hide under the bed.  Next she softly tells them it got quiet.  She says she heard footsteps, then she went to find her mom.  When she saw her mother was bleeding, she took the phone, ""even though I'm not allowed to, because it was an emergency.""  Finally she tells them her dad came home.  ""He was gone a long time.  The end.""  When Elliot asks, Ben explains that his job requires him to travel.  With a smile Katie says, ""We always drive Dad to the airport.""  Ben chuckles, tells her it's his turn to talk, and sends he off to explore the room.  When Olivia questions Ben about the large amount of money he gave the cabbie, Ben confesses that his relationship with Corinne was strained and he was circling the block putting off going home to face ""the inevitable fight"" with his wife.  When Elliot asks if anyone would have a grudge against Corinne and want to hurt her, Ben says no at first and explains that Katie recently had major heart surgery so they mostly socialize with parents of children with medical and developmental problems like hers.  Then he seems to suddenly recall that there had been some tension among the parents in their therapy group lately.  When Elliot asks why, Ben explains that he and Corinne had filed a ""wrongful birth"" suit against Gerald Morgan, a high-risk obstetrician who was popular among other parents in the group.  If they won, he would lose his insurance and have to quit practicing medicine and ""they didn't like that.""  Out in the hall, Cragen asks Benson and Stabler if they like Gerald Morgan as a suspect.  When they summarize their interview with Nicholson, Elliot emphasizes the facts that seem to indicate he is guilty while Olivia points out that ""couples fight, and he was out of town.""  Cragen says he will have Munch check to see when Ben's plane landed and Elliot suggests that they talk with the other couples from the therapy group.  Cragen asks why he thinks any of them will talk, and he explains that ""if they were unpopular someone's going to want to vent.""  At the Busken Group Counseling Center, the scene opens with a mother instructing her teenage son to pick up his brother from music camp and to come straight back to the center and not pick up his friends.  The teen answers that he heard her ""the first 1,000 times and Andrew likes my friends.""  Turning from her son, she spots Elliot and Olivia and greets them with, ""Hi.  I'm Tina Parven.  You must be new to our group.""  Seeming a little uncomfortable, Elliot tells her, ""Not exactly.""  Elliot interviews Paul and Ursula Wei, parents of a child with Down's syndrome.  When Elliot asks about the suit, Paul says ""They're litigious and I told them so.""  Ursula explains that Paul is a surgeon and he took the lawsuit personally.  Elliot asks if the Weis can tell him about their relationship and the scene cuts to Tina and Joel Parven who are talking with Olivia.  Tina says they were having troubles, and Joel tells Olivia there is more to their son Andrew than just Williams Syndrome but that it takes its toll on their marriage and his brother.  Tina then admits that she and Joel had separated twice and informs Olivia that Ben and Corinne had just gotten back together.  When Tina asks if Corinne can have visitors, Olivia tells her she'll have to talk to Ben about that.  Olivia asks how long the Nicholson's were separated, and the scene cuts to Elliot interviewing Jordana Weitz who says they had been separated for a couple of months.  Then she tells him that her husband couldn't take the stress and left her.  She tells Elliot that her daughter has Canavan Disease, and when he says he's not familiar with it, she goes on to explain that it causes progressive brain damage.  Her daughter wasn't supposed to survive long, but she's ten now.  Elliot asks if she was upset by the Nicholsons' wrongful birth suit.  She tells him she loves her daughter, but she lost her own lawsuit because Canavan's wasn't a standard test in the Ashkenazi Panel when she was pregnant, but it is now.  As they leave the counseling center, Olivia complains that the facts don't make sense.  She doesn't understand why, if the Nicholsons have just reconciled, Ben won't go into the house because he wants to avoid a fight.  When Elliot doesn't respond, she turns to him and asks awkwardly, ""How's Kathy?""  He responds, ""Over forty and having a baby.""  He admits to worrying about all the bad things that can happen, but when Olivia suggests they talk to a doctor, he tells her, ""We're Catholic.  Maybe it's better not to know.""  As Fin and Lake are seated in the waiting room of Dr. Gerald Morgan waiting to speak to him about the Nicholson's lawsuit, an expectant mother asks then if the doctor has told them whether ""it's a boy or a girl.""  Puzzled, Fin says politely, ""Excuse me?' and the woman begins talking about how she thinks it is wrong that they make it so hard for gay couples that they have to hire a surrogate.  She doesn't think it's right that they leave kids in the system rather than place them in a gay home and tells Lake and Fin, ""You seem like a nice couple to me.""  With a grin, Lake places his hand on Fin's thigh and rubs it affectionately.  Fin appears shocked and doesn't seem to know how to react until the receptionist calls, ""Detectives, you can go in now.""  Then he lightly bats Lake's hand away as he gets out of his seat.  The doctor is irritable but mostly cooperative as the detectives explain the reason for their visit.  He is offended that they think he might have raped and beaten Corrine Nicholson and explains that he was home alone because that it what he prefers after spending his day soothing terrified expectant parents.  When asked why his insurance company settled so often, he says sometimes it is cheaper to settle than to fight.  When Fin suggests it might be that he withheld details about unhealthy babies, he tells them the Nicholsons' lawsuit has no grounds because Corinne didn't have amniocentesis until it was too late for a legal abortion.  Then Fin asks for a DNA sample, and he offers on the spot to have his nurse come in and collect a buccal (cheek) swab.  Back at the station, Elliot tells Fin that Olivia and Lake are busy with trial prep, so it's just the two of them.  Fin finishes a call with the lab and Elliot guesses correctly that there were no hits on the doctor's DNA.  Elliot says that he still likes Ben Nicholson for the crime and supports his opinion with the fact that the Nicholson's ""insurance doesn't cover all of Katie's medical bills and they're drowning in debt.""  When Fin asks if the wife had life insurance, Munch enters the room saying she had a $500,000 policy and no record of Ben leaving on any flight.  Elliot observes that they now have motive and opportunity.  Munch pulls up video of Ben saying goodbye to Katie and his wife at the airport and then leaving the terminal to catch a cab.  Elliot and Fin bring Ben Nicholson in for interrogation.  He keeps insisting he can't answer their questions.  Elliot tells him their theory of the crime: that he ""went on a bogus business trip,"" and came home and beat up his wife the day he was supposed to return.  Ben insists that it did not happen that way, and tells them that since he's not under arrest he's going back to the hospital.  Elliot asks why he won't cooperate if someone else really hurt his wife.  Ben says he is cooperating as much as he can.  Just as he is about to walk out, Cragen comes in with FBI Agent Dean Porter and tells them the interview is over.  Porter tells Nicholson to wait outside and then he tells Fin and Elliot ""this is a homeland security issue"" and they are not to talk to Ben again without clearing it through his office.  Elliot grumbles that Nicholson is ""into something and now we can't touch him.""  Cragen reminds him that ""The Patriot Act trumps rape and attempted murder every time.""  In the meantime, Munch has done some research on Ben Nicholson's career as an aerosols engineer.  When he mentions ""anthrax and smallpox and aerosol cans with timers,"" Fin suspects that he's about to spin another conspiracy theory.  Munch tells them that Nicholson has spent a lot of time at Fort Dietrich, Maryland where they do research on biological weapons and that he with think tanks run by CEOs who are making money off the war.  Elliot says it still doesn't explain why the FBI needs him so badly.  Fin suggests that he is either a whistleblower or ""went rogue and they flipped him"" to use as an informant.  In the hall, Casey approaches Elliot and Fin with a warrant for Nicholson's DNA.  She tells them to ""take it publicly; just don't ask him any questions.""  Elliot wants to know when they can interview him again, and all she can tell him is that she is working on it.  In the meantime, the detectives can talk to everyone else in his life, friends, family, and neighbors in an effort to pressure him into coming to them.  At the hospital, Elliot and Fin find Tina and Joel Parven arguing about visiting Corinne Nicholson.  Tina says they are being supportive, but Joel feels they are intruding and says he has to get to work.  Elliot asks if Corinne is up for visitors and Tina tells him the nurse is checking and that Ben is with her now.  Then she asks Joel if he can stay for a little while and talk to Ben, but he refuses and leaves.  Elliot and Fin go into Corinne's hospital room to collect Ben's DNA and Agent Porter warns them that they are going to force him to file a formal complaint.  Fin tells him, ""Where you shove that is up to you,"" and presents him with the warrant.  Back out in the hallway, Porter insists that the police have the wrong guy and Elliot asks if Porter would ""vouch for someone just to save your investigation.""  Tina Parven is there to witness the DNA collection and she asks why they are treating Ben the way they are.  Fin tells her he might have been the one who attacked his wife because he wasn't out of town like he claimed to be.  She doesn't believe them and asks if they can ""just do this.""  Ben just shrugs.  Then the doctor shows up to tell Ben that his wife's condition is serious.  She is in a coma.  Elliot asks if she will come out of it and the doctor says they will just have to wait and see.  She further explains that they weren't able to save the baby she was carrying and she needs his consent to do a D & C to remove the fetus.  Ben is stunned to learn that she was pregnant as is Tina Parven.  Ben signs the consent forms and walks away in shock.  Fin and Elliot approach Tina to see if she has something to tell them.  She says she doesn't and Elliot says that even if she suspects something she needs to speak up.  She refuses and walks away.  Then Agent Porter approaches to warn them that if they don't stay away from Ben, ""next time the request will not be coming from me.""  Back at the squad room, Elliot and Fin discuss their frustrations over trying to interview Ben with Casey and Cragen.  Cragen asks if they have ""boxed the guy in"" and Elliot assures them that they had talked to every significant person in his life and they all know he's their prime suspect.  Casey tells them that she has ""filed an obstruction complaint and the hearing's tomorrow.""  Munch suggests that they talk to Katie again, but Elliot tells him that the previous interview with Katie wasn't very productive.  Munch says Elliot just didn't ask the right questions and tells them he has done some research and consulted with some experts.  Cragen doesn't like ""using an impaired minor to turn the screws on her father,"" but Casey points out that they have no other choice.  Grudgingly, Cragen asks what Munch has found out.  Munch explains, ""Children with Williams Syndrome are extremely empathetic, they study faces for signs of emotional stress . . . They're sensitive, eager to please, and affectionate, some have savant-like abilities, super hearing and perfect vision.""  As he is talking, Fin and Elliot recall behaviors they each witnessed that were indicative of the characteristics of kids like Katie.  When Elliot mentions she had to cover her ears when she heard her mother and her attacker yelling, Munch tells him, ""Which probably means she heard every word.  They confuse time, but they can tell you what was said and identify who said it.""  Casey asks what she could expect if she used Katie as a witness, and Munch tells her, ""Anxiety, ADD, and they have trouble taking criticism.""  Fin jokes, ""That sounds like you, Munch,"" and then asks if he really thinks she won't lie to protect her dad.  Munch informs them that she won't lie for her dad ""Because with Williams Syndrome have no guile.  They don't even know what deception is.""  Cragen gives the order to interview Katie again, and Casey says, ""Let's go.""  Elliot is taken aback that she proposes to go with them, and she asks him, ""Do you think he's going to let you talk to Katie without a fight?""  Nicholson is irate to find the police outside his door.  Piano music can be heard in the background as he is talking to Elliot, Casey, and Fin.  He refuses to let them talk to Katie, but as he is about to close the door in their faces, Casey steps forward and blocks the door.  She explains how she will file a request for a hearing and get a court order allowing them to interview Katie because she is the only witness to the attack and he is their prime suspect.  Reluctantly, he lets them in.  When they enter the room where Katie is playing the piano, she enthusiastically greets Elliot and Fin.  Casey holds out her hand to shake and introduces her self in a friendly manner.  Katie ignores her hand altogether and instead gives Casey a hug and says, ""Pretty.""  Casey's just a little surprised by the hug, but when she looks at Elliot he just shrugs.  Fin tells Katie they have some more questions for her, and Elliot explains that he doesn't want to upset her so she can tell them to stop any time she wants.  Katie agrees and asks her dad to sit with her.  Looking miserable, Ben refuses, but assures her he will be in his seat right across the room.    As before, Katie repeats what she heard verbatim.  First someone yelled, ""You're ripping our family apart.""  When Elliot asks if she recognized the voice, she says it was her dad and that her parents ""were fighting.  They always fight.""  Fin asks what happened next, and she says her mom yelled, ""I hate you.""  Then she claps her hands together.  Fin looks at Nicholson and asks, ""You slapped her?""  Ben hides his face in shame.  Fin asks, ""Was that it?"" and Katie says, ""Come here baby, you smell good,"" in an approximation of seductive voice.  Casey asks if that was her dad and she says her dad wasn't home or ""the man"" wouldn't have been there.  Elliot asks if the man has been in the house before and she nods.  He asks if she saw him and she says, ""I heard him.  I always do,"" and she repeats, ""Come here baby, you smell good,"" exactly the way she said it before.  When Elliot asks, she assures him she would recognize the man's voice because she has perfect pitch.  She tells him she told her dad about the man and, imitating her dad's voice, she tells them that he said, ""Everything is going to be all right.  We're a family and we're going to stay together no matter what.""  Then in her own voice she finishes with, ""The end.""  Nicholson is distraught and covers his face with his hands.  Katie crosses the room to her dad, sits in his lap, and gives him a hug.    As they leave the building, the detectives seem more convinced than ever that Ben is guilty.  Elliot is sure he was ""using that shady terrorism threat to cover his ass.""  Fin says, ""He almost got away with it,"" and Casey warns them, ""He still may.""  At the federal courthouse, Casey meets with Assistant U.S. Attorney Marion Springer.  After stonewalling her briefly, Springer tells Casey, ""He was with us.""  Casey asks, ""The whole time,"" and Springer replies, ""Need to know.""  When Casey presses for more information, Springer serves her with papers.  Casey looks at them and says, ""The Patriot Act.  This convoluted piece of legislation isn't worth the paper it's written on.""  As she storms out of the courtroom, Springer tells her to ""save it for the judge.""  Back at the 16th precinct, Olivia and Lake meet Cragen in the hallway near the elevator.  Olivia asks what's up and Lake informs Cragen that the DA wasn't happy because they weren't through with their trial preparations.  Cragen informs that it will have to wait because the Nicholson case is not going well and he needs them back on it.  He tells them that Tina Parven has come in to make a statement.  She is waiting in the interview room, and he needs them to get something useful out of her.  He gets in the elevator and Olivia asks where he is going.  He tells them COMMSTAT.  Tina tells Lake and Olivia that she didn't think Ben would hurt Corinne but she isn't so sure now because Corinne was cheating.  When Lake asks how she knew, she explains that Corinne was pregnant, but Ben didn't want more children.  Olivia suggests that Tina would understand Ben's reluctance to have another child ""given the circumstances,"" and Tina explains that Williams Syndrome is a mutation.  It isn't inherited unless the parent has it.  Then she explains that ""Ben didn't want to take any attention away from Katie, they argued about it, and Corinne freaked when he had a vasectomy without telling her."" Olivia asks who she was sleeping with, and Tina says she doesn't have a clue.  Corinne is her closest friend but ""I guess she thought I wouldn't approve.""  Then Munch walks in to tell them, ""Corinne Nicholson is awake.""  When Lake and Olivia arrive at the hospital, Corinne is agitated and confused.  Olivia tries to explain to her that she is the hospital because she was attacked, but she continues resisting the doctors and insisting that she needs to go get Katie ready for surgery.   ""She has aortic stenosis . . . She gets so scared.""  The doctors sedate her, and as she succumbs to the medication, Lake assures her that her family is fine.  When Olivia tells the doctor that Katie was scheduled for surgery six months ago, the doctor tells the Corinne probably has retrograde amnesia and that her memories from the surgery to the present, including the attack, may never return.  Out in the hall, Casey has joined them and the doctor informs them that Corinne thinks it is April, 2007.  When Olivia asks when she'll get her memory back, the doctor says there is cure for retrograde amnesia, and no way to know if or what she will eventually recall.  The doctor tells them Ben hasn't returned her calls, and Corinne needs family and support to recover from her injury.  The doctor apologizes that she doesn't have better news for them, and when Olivia asks, Casey says their next move is to go to court.   In Judge Trenton's chambers, Casey mentions that Nicholson was not out of town as he said he was and points out that unless the FBI can account for every minute of his time up to the attack, their assurances that he didn't assault his wife are worthless.  Marion Springer says that in order to corroborate Nicholson's story, the police have to speak to ""people of interest.  That can't happen.""  Casey sarcastically asks, ""So your work trumps putting rapists and murderers behind bars because there's a terrorist behind every corner?""  Springer responds, ""You have no physical evidence linking Mr. Nicholson with his wife's attack, or should we just wait while you fabricate some?""  The judge reprimands Springer, but rules that Casey's appeal is premature without evidence.  Out in the hall, Springer tells Casey that Nicholson is bait for buyers for rogue nations trying to buy trade secrets.  Casey understands what the FBI is using him for, but ""The problem is, he nearly killed his wife and you're protecting him for a sting operation.""  Back in the squad room, the detectives, Cragen and Casey discuss their status on the case.  Nicholson is off limits unless they find physical evidence.  With no prints on the weapon, even if the DNA from the rape kit matches, Ben can just say she consented to sex. They can't prove rape anyway, because Corinne doesn't remember the last six months, not even the rape of her pregnancy.  Lake says it's a good thing they didn't tell her why they let her husband go, and Cragen says ""unless he tried it again.""  Munch comes in with the DNA results and tells them Ben did not rape Corinne.  Fin says that doesn't matter because he still could have attacked her for cheating on him.  Benson and Stabler question Joel Parven, and he insists that nothing happened.  He admits to being with Corinne and that she did tell him about the baby, but when Elliot suggests that he attacked her because he was angry that the baby was threatening his faltering marriage, he denies it.  He admits that he was angry, but says he had been there to break it off only to end up in bed with her.  He tells them, ""I was stupid and reckless, but I didn't hit her.  She was fine when I left her.""  When Olivia asks, he tells them he left around eleven and went home.  Then he tells them that they're going to have to arrest him if they want to talk more, because they can't keep him without charging him.  Elliot and Olivia go into the observation room to speak with Casey and Cragen.  Olivia says they'll never get a confession, and Elliot suggests they do a voice lineup and get Katie to identify him.  Casey suggests that because of her disability the ID might be inadmissible and even if it is, if she is challenged on the stand, she might break down. Elliot says she's not stupid, but Cragen quotes him from earlier saying, ""She's developmentally challenged and an emotional rollercoaster.""  Casey isn't even sure she could be sworn as a witness, but Olivia points out that unless Katie makes the ID, Parven will walk.  Casey nods her head indicating that they should go ahead and try.  In the lineup, a series of men repeat the line, ""Come here, baby, you smell good.""  Ben Nicholson is in the lineup, and when a nervous Katie looks at him over her shoulder, he reassures her that it's ok.  Parven's defense attorney, Chauncey Zierko, comments that it sounds more like seduction than a rape.  When Parven speaks, she identifies him immediately.  Elliot asks if she is sure and she nods.  Casey tells Zierko that Katie identified his client and Zierko questions her credibility and implies that a trial would be a waste of everyone's time.  Then Katie begins to reenact the argument that she heard between her mother and Parven.  ""Leave me alone!  I want a baby that can grow up, be normal.  That's what I want!"" she shouts what her mother said.  Her father tries to tell her not to say anything more, but Elliot tells him they need to hear what she has to say.  ""Too damn bad,"" she says in a deeper voice for a man.  ""You're breaking up my home you selfish bitch,"" she continues, and then in her mother's voice yells, ""Ow!  You're hurting me!""  As herself, she says, ""Then, bam!  Mom was crying.  Then bam, bam, bam!  Then breathing.""  In the man's voice she says, ""Bitch.""  Then she finishes with, ""Then he went away, but he used the wrong word.  That's not what it means, is it, Dad?""  She looks at her father, he shakes his head, and she says, ""The end.""  Elliot asks if the man who fought with her mother is the voice in the other room, and she says no.  He asks if she is sure and she explains that his voice is too low.  Zierko looks relieved; the others look shocked and defeated.  Ben kisses Katie on the forehead.  Out in the squad room, Alex Parven comes to pick up his dad.  He asks why the cops took him and if he is all right.  Joel assures his son that he is fine and tells him the police have released him.  As she is leaving the squad room with Ben, Katie overhears their conversation and drags her dad over to Joel and Alex Parven.  Alex says he knows his dad wouldn't hurt Corinne, and at that point Katie accuses Alex, ""You used the wrong word!  A bitch is a female dog.""  Now all eyes are on Alex.  Elliot asks Katie again, ""Are you sure?"" and Katie yells, ""My mother is not a bitch.""  Joel looks at his son and asks, ""What the hell'd you do?""  As Elliot takes Alex away, he calls to his father, and Joel tells him, ""Don't say anything, not to anyone.  I'll get you out as soon as I can.""  Later that night, Ben Nicholson shows up at the precinct to find Elliot still at work.  He asks if Alex confessed, and Elliot tells him he got a lawyer and hasn't said anything.  Ben confides that he was hoping Alex would confess so that Katie wouldn't have to testify.  Elliot tells him that the Parvens had separated twice before and the police think Alex was afraid the affair was going to kill their marriage so he followed his dad, waited for him to leave, and then went in and attacked Corinne.  When Ben asks if he can prove that, he says they can't and that's why they need Katie to testify.  Ben tells him he wants the case finished because he and Katie can't move on until it's over.  He tells Elliot to let him know when, and he'll bring Katie to court.  Elliot promises that he will shield Katie from as much as possible.  At the swearability hearing in Judge Petrovsky's courtroom, Zierko again suggests that the court proceedings are a waste of time because of Katie's disability.  As Elliot slips quietly into the courtroom, Casey reminds the judge that Katie ""clearly heard the attack on her mother and identified the defendant.""  Petrovsky asks if Katie is there to be examined and Casey has to ask for a continuance because Katie is not there.  Zierko objects on the grounds that they were all made aware of the date and time for the hearing.  Casey argues that ""the minor has Williams Syndrome.  Her mother is just out of a coma.""  Petrovsky is sympathetic but reminds Casey that it is the parent's responsibility to present her.  She asks where Ben is and Casey looks back at Elliot who just shakes his head and shrugs.  Casey says they are looking for Ben, and Petrovsky give the prosecution twenty-four hours to find her before she dismisses the case.  Elliot meets Agent Dean Porter in a restaurant and asks him where Ben is.  Porter doesn't reply.  Elliot asks, ""Do you care at all, or is this guy just a pawn to you?""  Porter calls him a bastard.  Elliot says, ""Well, I get that a lot.""  Porter admits he doesn't have Ben, that he's gone ""off grid,"" and that Porter's case is in trouble without him.  Porter says, ""There are people he's supposed to be talking to, and instead he's protecting his kid from you.""  Elliot asks, ""Do you think I enjoy making Katie relive that moment?""  Porter replies, ""I don't blame the guy.  I mean, what would you do in his place?""  ""Hide her in the last place anybody would look,"" Elliot replies with a flash of insight and gets up to go, leaving some money on the table to pay his part of the bill.  ""You find him, you let me know,"" Porter demands.  ""You'll be my first call,"" Elliot responds insincerely.  Out on the street, Elliot finds Tina Parven.  She asks how he found her and he explains that she uses the bank card a lot in the area and that he had just followed her from the store where she had used it to buy groceries.  She asks what he wants and he tells her he needs to take Katie with him.  She claims she doesn't know what he's talking about, but he doesn't believe her.  He tells her she's the perfect caretaker because she knows all about Katie's condition.  Keeping Katie for Ben lets him protect his daughter while Tina protects Alex.  She tells Elliot he's crazy, and he tells her the charges she could be facing if she refuses to hand Katie over.  She relents and tells him where Katie is.  Back in court, Casey asks if Katie knows what a lie is.  Katie responds that it's when you say something that isn't true.  When Casey asks if she has ever told a like, Katie describes an incident where someone made her a grilled cheese sandwich with ""things in it"" but she ate it so the person who made it would think she liked it.  Then she asks Casey if that's a lie.  Casey assures her it is not, and then submits to the judge that Katie can be sworn as a witness.  Petrovsky agrees and then bangs her gavel.  Katie jumps and shouts ""Don't do that!"" and Casey explains that she has very sensitive hearing.  Petrovsky apologizes; Katie accepts the apology and asks for a hug.  Surprised, Petrovsky says, ""N-no.""  Katie looks a little hurt and Petrovsky relents, ""Maybe later.""  Casey asks Katie if the man who was in the bedroom with Corinne said anything other than, ""Come here baby, you smell good.""  To the embarrassment of all the adults in the room, she begins moaning and grunting in a fair approximation of the sounds someone would make during sex.  Alex Parven looks accusingly at his dad, and Petrovsky cuts Katie off.  Then Casey asks Katie if she identified Alex Parven as the man who argued with and hurt her mother.  Katie says he did, but ""He used the wrong word.  But my dad says it's really a bad word for girls.""  When Casey asks how she could tell the difference between the voices of Joel and Alex Parven, she explains that she studies music and their voices are different in tempo, pitch, and timber.  ""I know what I heard.  The end.""  Outside the courtroom, Elliot is waiting for Ben Nicholson.  When he asks Ben where he's been, Ben replies, ""Doing what I do best, looking out for my daughter's future.""  Elliot asks if that's what his meeting was really about or if he was just trying to keep Katie from testifying.  Ben insisted that their priorities are different.  Elliot is trying to put someone in jail and Ben is just ""trying to make sure Katie is happy and safe.""  Elliot tells him, ""She's not as fragile as you think she is.""  Ben scoffs and asks if Elliot is an expert.  Elliot says, ""No, I just know a liar when I see one.""  Ben gets defensive and asks Elliot what he means.  Elliot says he's more worried about himself than he is about his daughter.  Ben insists that Zierko attorney is going to ""rip her to shreds"" because Joel Parven has a child with Williams Syndrome and can tell Zierko about all of Katie's weaknesses.  Elliot tells him he left Katie with Tina Parven so he could take a meeting, not to protect Katie.  When Ben says Elliot knows nothing about it, Elliot elaborates, telling him he knows the FBI is looking for him, that he went ""off grid,"" and that he took the meeting without the FBI knowing about it.  Ben says that not everything he does is their business.  Elliot implies that he is into some illegal activities and tells Ben he better think of a better excuse than protecting Katie for the FBI.  Then Elliot Agent Porter arrives and thanks Elliot ""for the heads up.""  Back in the courtroom, Zierko asks Katie what she did today.  She begins reciting a list of activities and makes a face when she mentions eating a grilled cheese sandwich.  Zierko cuts her off and asks what she did yesterday.  She can't answer and he asks impatiently, ""What about the day before that?""  Casey objects to his badgering, but is overruled when Zierko insists that he's asking simple questions.  If she can't handle them, ""what'll it be like at trial?""  He asks Katie what time her mother was attacked.  She recalls that she was in her nightgown and guesses it was bedtime.  Zierko tells her she was wrong, that it was much later.  He asks if she saw that attacker's face, and she said she was under the bed.  He asks if she had met Alex Parven before and she says yes.  Quickly he asks why she didn't tell anyone he had hurt her mother.  Katie tells him, ""You're upsetting me.  Go away!""  Talking faster, Zierko asks, ""Didn't the police ask you over and over who did it?""  Elliot has to take a deep breath as Zierko continues, insisting, ""Katie, tell the truth, it wasn't Alex, was it?  You just want to please Miss Novak, isn't that why you said he did it?""    Casey objects as Zierko likens the case to another incident where a witness with Williams Syndrome said what the police wanted to hear simply because that is one of the characteristics of the condition.  Casey insists that Katie hasn't changed her story since the beginning, ""Despite counsel's attempt to badger and confuse her.""  Zierko disbelievingly asks if Casey would ""have us believe that she heard it under a bed, through walls and closed doors.""  Casey defiantly tells him, ""I can prove that she heard every single word.""  She hands Petrovsky and Zierko each a sheet of paper and explains that she will ask Katie the three questions that appear on it.  Turning away from her, covering her mouth, and whispering, she asks the three questions.  Each of Katie's answers is consistent with her previous testimony and the evidence the police have:  Alex hurt her mother, he did it because she was hurting her family by having a baby, and her dad told her not to tell anyone about getting money from someone named Mr. Kim so he could go away.  Casey asks who Mr. Kim is.  Elliot leans forward, very interested in her answer, and Katie says, ""He brings my dad money in a briefcase.  The end.""     Elliot meets Ben Nicholson at the hospital and tells him that Alex Parven is making a plea agreement and Katie won't have to testify.  He says Ben ought to be relieved ""since Katie won't have to reveal anymore secrets in open court.""  Ben tells them the FBI owns him now so it doesn't matter anymore.  Elliot says he cut a deal like any thief.  Ben says he had already turned Mr. Kim in; he just kept the money without telling the FBI about it. Elliot comments that it must have been a lot of money for him to take such a risk and asks what he sold.  Ben says it was a prototype for a dispersion system that doesn't work.  Elliot asks how his wife is doing, and Ben corrects him, saying, ""My soon-to-be ex.""  Ben tells him she is well enough to be discharged, but he doesn't know or care where she is going after she leaves the hospital.  Elliot reminds him that she doesn't remember any of it, and Ben laughs sarcastically, saying, ""Isn't that convenient?""  Then he goes into Corinne's hospital room to tell Katie it is time to go.  She begins happily pushing her mom's wheelchair out as if they are all going home together, but Ben insists that Corinne is not going home with them.  The episode ends with Ben, tearing a hysterical Katie away from her distraught mother and forcing her into an elevator while Elliot looks on uncomfortably."

She heard the words, ""Help me, and then a name. Savannah, Samantha…"" Officer Tim suggests Sabrina and the woman says that was the name. He approaches Sanjay, the corner hotdog vendor who knows his name and anticipates his order, but Officer Tim shakes his head and instead shows the man a picture of a young girl and asks if Sanjay has seen her today.  Sanjay says no, and the officer asks about a car parked at the bus stop about two hours ago. Sanjay says it was towed.  Officer Tim calls in a ""Possible sighting on kidnap victim Sabrina Farmer. Notify SVU that she might be in the trunk of an impounded car.""In the next scene, we see the SVU squad smashing windows and popping trunks on cars in a police impound lot.  They don't know which car it is because the traffic division's computer system is down, but when Cragen questions how they know it's in Queens, Olivia tells him that ""Pier 76 is full and this is where Manhattan is sending their overflow.""  When Cragen asks if anyone is checking the paperwork to identify the vehicle, Elliot assures him that the tow-truck drivers have been notified that they are looking for a missing child.  A siren is heard as Cragen asks where the infrared camera is, and Olivia tells him Emergency Services is on the way.  O'Halloran arrives with an infrared camera and a moment later, ESU joins them with another.  Cragen deploys them, and a moment later, O'Halloran finds something in a gray Impala. Fin breaks the window and pops the trunk, and Elliot opens the trunk to find Sabrina Farmer, bloody and barely breathing. Cragen calls for oxygen, but Lake informs him that EMS is stuck in traffic. Olivia says, ""We'll take her,"" and Elliot lifts Sabrina out of the trunk.  The scene ends with him running through the lot with Sabrina in his arms.The next scene begins with the doctor leaving Sabrina's room to speak with Benson and Stabler in the hall. ""Sabrina's CAT scan didn't show any bleeding, but she does have a serious concussion.""  Sabrina's parents can be seen through the window over the doctor's shoulder as she tells the detectives that Sabrina was most likely hit in the head with a rock- there was dirt in the wound. Benson asks when she will wake up, and the doctor has no idea. When Elliot asks is she was raped, the doctor confirms it. There were no fluids, but they did find several hairs and extensive bruising.  The doctor comments that Sabrina is only eleven, and Olivia tells her, ""Don't ask why. It will just make you crazy.""  The doctor leaves saying she will call the detectives when Sabrina is conscious.As they walk down the hall planning their next move, Elliot says they can go back to the security cameras, but Olivia reminds him that they will only see what they saw before: Sabrina leaving a bookstore alone and nobody following her.  As they turn the corner, Lake meets them and informs them that they have information on the Impala in which they found Sabrina.  The driver's name is Saul Picard from Mandeville, Louisiana; he picked it up from Escape Rent-a-Car three days ago.  Elliot fears that if he is a tourist, he is gone from the city, but Lake tells him that Picard signed a month-long lease an executive apartment.Benson and Stabler go to Picard's apartment. The room is sparsely decorated and messy with Picard's things scattered about.  Picard appears disheveled and his hair is messed up. As he examines their identification, Olivia tells him they're there about his rental car. ""The one I returned yesterday?"" Elliot informs him that the rental agency has on record of its return. Olivia asks to use the bathroom, and after telling her where it is, Picard produces a receipt for Elliot and tells him the clerk's name was Mickey.  When Picard asks, Elliot tells him the car was stolen. Picard says he can't be held responsible for anything that happened after he dropped it off.When Elliot asks where he's been, Picard says he was in the apartment working and he went to the deli on the corner a few times for coffee and burgers. Seeing something on the table, Elliot comments, ""You're an artist."" Picard acknowledges, ""That's not what my critics say."" Elliot crosses the room and picks up a drawing of an elephant and asks Picard, ""Have we met before?"" Picard says it's doubtful. He's in New York every few months on business, but he lives in Louisiana. Elliot asks if he lives near New Orleans. Picard says he lives on the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain, but he is looking to relocate because Katrina destroyed his house two years ago and it's not the same anymore. Elliot says he wouldn't blame Picard for trying to get away. Olivia returns from the bathroom and Picard asks to see their credentials again.  They show their IDs, he thanks them for indulging him, and Elliot thanks him for his time. Down at the deli, Elliot is wrapping up a phone conversation as Olivia comes out with a couple of cups of coffee. Elliot explains that he has found out that Picard's story about the car checks out. When he returned it, Mickey, the clerk, didn't have enough room for it in the garage, so he left it on the street with the keys in it. When someone stole it, he was afraid he would lose his job, so he went back into the computer and changed the records to make it look like Picard hadn't returned it yet. Olivia tells Elliot that the clerk in the deli recognized Picard and that he had been in a couple of dozen times over the past couple of days. She calls him a ""caffeine freak,"" and Elliot adds, ""Not to mention a paranoid freak, asking for our IDs twice? Bad case of OCD."" (obsessive compulsive disorder) ""Not to mention BO,"" Olivia adds. She tells Elliot the shower was dry as if it had never been used and the bedroom was messy but there was no sign that Sabrina had been there. Elliot comments that all they have left is the car.At the crime lab, O'Halloran informs them that the only trace evidence they have been able to find is some pollen from a Louisiana flat sedge, which could only have been transferred by close physical contact like sitting in the seat where it was found…or raping Sabrina while she was sitting there. Elliot asks if that grows anywhere near Lake Ponchartrain and O'Halloran answers, ""Around the bayous on the north shore. How'd you know?"" Benson and Stabler return to Picard's apartment and kick in the door, but the place has been cleared out completely. They and realize that Picard is the one who saw the keys in the car when he left the rental agency and stole the car right back. Elliot states the obvious: ""Oh, we screwed up.""Back in the squad room, Cragen orders, ""No press, but I want every cop on the street looking for this guy."" Elliot suggests that with an eighteen-hour head start, if he were Picard, he would be fleeing to Brazil (which has no extradition treaty with the U.S.). Fin reports that his DNA is not in the system and the FBI has nothing on him. Lake says Sabrina could be his first victim, but Fin argues that serial rapists usually start out closer to home.  Cragen asks if they checked with the Louisiana police and Olivia says Picard only has two unpaid speeding tickets.  Munch arrives with information that Picard rented a blue Ford Explorer from the same agency where he got the Impala the previous afternoon- right after Elliot and Olivia visited him, and just before they put the alert out on him. Munch also reports that Picard did not check out of his apartment or purchase any airline tickets to flee. Fin is surprised that Picard is ""sticking around."" Cragen orders for the description of the Explorer to be circulated. Olivia, tapping on her keyboard, tells him it's already done,  then takes a call. Lake asks if they should stake out Picard's apartment, but Elliot doubts he'll go back. Olivia hangs up and tells them Sabrina is awake.At Mercy General Hospital, Olivia interviews Sabrina while Elliot keeps his distance. Sabrina says she was looking at some books when Picard told her she was in danger and her mom was waiting for her outside. He went ""out through the coffee place"" which Olivia says ""explains why he wasn't on the surveillance camera."" Sabrina says her mom wasn't outside, but Picard said her mother was hurt and he would take her home if she told him where she lived. She got into his car, but he went the wrong way. She tried to get out but the doors were locked. At Olivia's prompting, Sabrina remembers that he said he was taking her ""someplace safe"", that he talked ""funny,"" and he said ""hearken to the ark."" She admits she didn't understand most of what Picard said. While Olivia shows Sabrina a photo array, Elliot's cell phone rings and he goes out into the hall to take the call. Sabrina easily identifies Picard and tells Olivia that ""He said his name was William,"" and he took her to a park. She tried to run away, but he said, ""Stop, Francine."" Before Sabrina can continue, Elliot opens the door and urgently gestures Olivia to join him, so she leaves Sabrina to rest.As they leave the hospital, Olivia asks hopefully if they caught Picard, but Elliot tells her another girl has been taken. At the library, Lake tells Stabler it fits Picard's MO as Fin shows an assistant a picture and asks if he knows the girl. The assistant confirms that she was sitting at a nearby table picking out some books.  Elliot picks up a book and reads the cover: ""Button's Quest, by William S Falstaff."" ""I read this to my kids,"" he comments. ""You and a million other parents,"" the assistant tells him.  Olivia arrives telling them that Picard was seen on the surveillance tape leading Eve Holland out forty-five minutes ago. Elliot curses and when Fin asks, he tells the group that he knew he recognized Picard. Opening the book to reveal the picture on the back flap, he tells them that Picard is Falstaff.  Fin holds up a book titled, ""Secret of the Arch,"" and comments on the pen name. Elliot and Olivia recall what Sabrina said about ""hearkening the ark,"" and then discuss where he might have taken her in the city. There's not enough cover at the Arch in Washington Square Park, but ultimately, they settle on the Arch at Grand Army Plaza in Central Park.Benson and Stabler arrive at the park to find a uniformed lieutenant, Lieutenant Shea, already organizing a manhunt. They identify themselves and Olivia asks if anyone has spotted them yet. He says no, but he has a chopper up and they're calling in some more manpower. She says the girl was snatched less than two hours ago so if they work fast they might find her before she gets hurt. Shea says they'll do their best, but it's a big park. Another officer who has been on the radio while they were talking interrupts to tell them that the chopper spotted something in the trees on Lookout Hill. Shea orders his men to mount up, and Elliot suggests that Picard might hurt Eve if ""all the troops"" spook him. Shea agrees to let Benson and Stabler go in first.They rescue Eve, who has been drugged to make her sleep, and apprehend Picard, who is also sleeping in the driver's seat, without incident. As they are taking him back to the waiting officers, he rants about various things- including Alice in Wonderland, the car that was towed, his lawyer who is an expert on pralines, and G.W. Bush's determination to keep the U.S. troops in Iraq. As they arrive at Grand Army Plaza, Picard sees a rolling billboard that says, ""Winter's coming…Time to escape."" He mutters, ""Oh, OK."" Elliot asks, ""OK, what?"" but Picard is non responsive, asking instead, ""Do I have to do it now? It's going to be really hard."" He starts insisting, ""I gotta get away."" He struggles a little, and when Elliot tries to restrain him, he head butts Elliot with such force that Elliot falls backwards into the side of the car and shatters the window with his head. Olivia runs to his aid and orders the other officers call a bus and get Picard. She crouches beside Elliot, cradling his head in her arms and telling him he's OK and a bus is on the way.Elliot wakes in the hospital and asks, ""What's going on?"" Kathy gasps and tells Olivia and the nurse that he's awake.  A relieved Olivia comes over to stand near the bed and says ""Welcome back, El."" He asks again what's going on, and Olivia tells him, ""You're in the hospital.  You're OK."" ""I'm not OK. Where are you?"" he says. His vision has been affected by his injury.  All he can see are blurry shadows. He calls his wife's name, and Kathy takes his hand.Out in the hall, the doctor explains his injury and that his brain bounced off the front and the back of his skull. Temporary blindness is not uncommon, but it's a good thing that he can see bright colors, light, and shadows. Fin arrives to report that there is trouble in Picard's room and Cragen leaves. Olivia tries to get the doctor to give a definite time when Elliot's vision will return, but the doctor only tells her, ""His MRI showed some swelling in the optic nerve. We'll know more in a few days.""In Picard's room, Cragen finds that the FBI has come to take him away. Cragen tells Special Agent Wayne Nelson that the Feds don't have jurisdiction because Picard didn't cross state lines. Nelson informs him that he kidnapped a nine-year-old girl in Mississippi and took her to Louisiana where he raped her and left her to die.Back in the squad room, Munch tells them about Tiffany Lemarsh, who was kidnapped from a bookstore in a shopping mall in Gulfport, Mississippi. She was raped by Picard and left in his house for four days without food and water. She was found barely alive when the neighbor's dog got her scent and led them to her.Casey arrives wanting to know who notified the Feds. When asked if she did, she says no. Lake says they just picked him up that morning and didn't even get him into the system before the Feds showed up. Olivia asks if she can do anything about it, but Casey informs her that the State of New York doesn't even get an extradition hearing. Munch says the indictment is a crock. Picard kidnapped Tiffany in Mississippi, but they indicted him in Louisiana. Olivia tells him he raped her in Louisiana. That makes it part of the same crime and they can try him in either state. Munch says once the FBI gets Picard, they are going to drop the kidnapping charges and let Louisiana try him for the rape. Casey explains that raping a child under the age of twelve in Louisiana is a capital crime.Casey goes to Barry Moredock, who can't understand why she is upset about the situation. The FBI is saving her a lot of work. She explains, ""The Feds are pushing their own agenda,"" by taking Picard to Louisiana because they have the death penalty for Picard's crime and New York doesn't. She says, ""I'm not going to let them abuse their power and emasculate the authority of my office."" She asks Moredock to take Picard's case, pro bono, because she doesn't have any legal standing to request a hearing. The Feds are trying to get Picard ""under the table"" which is ""a violation of due process."" Since Moredock is a Constitutional lawyer, he gleefully accepts. As they part, she explains that Picard ""has some psychiatric issues"" and gets Moredock's permission to have Huang evaluate him.Picard explains to Huang that the sign in the park that said, ""It's time to escape"" was a message to him. Another one on a billboard said, ""You really need to get away,"" and that's when he abandoned the car with Sabrina in the trunk at the bus stop. He tells Huang that Francine, his sister, is sending the messages ""because those boys raped her."" As the interview progresses, Picard starts hearing voices. Huang learns that when Picard was seventeen and Francine was eleven, he arrived home from school to find several boys taking turns with his sister. He froze and couldn't do anything to help her. The stress of that moment triggered his first psychotic break. His first medication, Haldol, worked for many years until Francine died but then it quit. The only thing that worked after that was Risperidone, but that left him feeling like he was ""swimming through wet cement"" so he quit taking it.That's when the messages started. Picard goes on to describe a hallucination in which he saw Francine and the boys who raped her at the bookstore in Gulfport. The boys were gathered around her and ""she was in terrible danger."" So he took her some place safe, but the boys found them. Two of them held him down and the other raped Francine. Then he set a trap. He took Francine to New York and lured the boys to the Arch (Arc) where he beat them with rocks when they came to rape her.When Huang and Novak discuss the case, Huang tells her Picard is not a pedophile, he's a schizophrenic and he kidnapped those girls because he thought they were his sister and he was saving them. Casey asks if he will remember what he did, and Huang says it's possible once his medicine takes effect, if it takes effect. He explains that it's possible nothing will help him in times of great stress. Casey asks if that means he might not make it through a trial and Huang is surprised that she is thinking of putting him through one. He insists that Picard is sick and putting him in prison is ""no less cruel and unusual than the Feds trying to execute him."" Casey says she will take his opinion under advisement, and at that moment gets a text message that Moredock has won the hearing and the Feds can't take Picard.As she is walking in the courthouse hall,  after her meeting with Huang she is approached by the press. She tells them that she expects Louisiana to file for extradition, but Picard is in New York and they are going to keep him. When asked about her beliefs on capital punishment, she says what she believes is irrelevant. It is not the law in New York, but if it becomes New York law, she will enforce it to the best of her ability. As she is watching herself on the press conference in her office, Barry Moredock appears and says, ""I hope you mean that,"" meaning that she isn't letting Picard go back to Louisiana. She says she plans to try him in New York, and Moredock gives her a motion for extradition and tells her Picard wants to talk to her. In the Rikers Island Mental Health Wing, Picard's medication is working now, and he knows what he has done. Picard invites Casey to call him Saul and asks her to tell the victims he is sorry and requests to be sent back to Louisiana. He wants to face the death penalty because he thinks he doesn't deserve to live saying, ""If the state thinks that killing me will stop one pervert from doing what I did to those poor little girls, then it's worth it."" Out in the hall, she and Moredock debate Picard's sanity. She tells him to file for a 730 hearing to have Picard declared incompetent, but Picard won't let him. He asks Casey to file for the hearing, because if he's declared incompetent he can't waive extradition. However, he can't be tried in New York, either. Moredock suggests she make a deal, he pleads guilty and she sends him to a mental institution, but Casey argues that Jack McCoy won't allow that. Moredock accuses her of being ""a team player instead of doing the right thing.""Back in the squad room, the detectives debate the wisdom of forcing the mentally ill to take medication.  Lake is against it, saying he didn't know when he went off his meds that he would ""turn into Godzilla."" Olivia argues that he was lucid when he made the decision to stop, that makes him responsible. Fin agrees with Liv saying there should be a special law for people like Picard: ""Take your meds or we're gonna force feed 'em to you."" Casey offers no opinion until Olivia asks if she can prove he knew he hurt someone. Casey is confident that she can get a conviction with Sabrina Farmer's testimony. Then Lake asks if he goes back to Louisiana to face the death penalty. She says yes, if they let him, and Lake says, ""Don't let him, Casey."" Lake, Fin, and Olivia argue briefly about executing child molesters. Lake says, ""It's a no-brainer. The death penalty's never been a deterrent for murder."" Fin points out that murderers usually strike once, child rapists repeat. Lake points out that if you threaten to kill them, they have no reason not to kill their victims to silence them. Olivia tells them, ""But execute them and they'll never hurt another child.""Casey requests Olivia's paperwork on the case, and Olivia asks when she will be needed in court. Casey says she won't need Liv. She's going to use just Sabrina and Elliot. Olivia tells Casey she doesn't need Elliot, ""I saw everything that Picard did."" Casey says she didn't hear what Picard said and she needs Elliot there to show the jury the kind of damage Picard can inflict. Olivia argues that ""the police surgeon said Elliot can't leave his house until his vision's back."" ""Unless he has to appear in court,"" Casey reminds her. Olivia implies that the stress could hinder his recovery. Both women get rather testy, and Casey decides that Elliot should make the decision for himself and leaves the squad room.Casey goes to Elliot's house. He still has two black eyes from his injury and he tells her his vision is still blurry. She asks if he feels up to testifying against Picard. He talks about how he's going to be a father again soon and how frightened he was that he might never see that child. ""So Picard? Bring him on.""In court, Elliot testifies about how Picard head butted him and he was injured. He tells the jury he was temporarily blinded, and when asked to identify Picard, he puts on a pair of strong glasses and points him out. Casey asks if he would consider Picard dangerous, and Elliot says he is extremely dangerous. Then Casey asks Picard was saying anything when he attacked Elliot, and Elliot says he was saying over and over, ""It's time to escape."" Casey begins to get a little more assertive as she tells Elliot about the sign that Picard thought was a message for him and asks if Elliot saw it. Elliot begins to seem slightly confused about where Casey's questions are going, but he says he did. She asks if Picard was distraught and he says yes. She asks if Picard qualifies as an EDP. Barry Moredock looks surprised. Elliot begins to look as if he has figured out what Casey is doing, and he doesn't like it, but he answers honestly, ""Yes,"" and at Casey's direction tells the jury that an EDP is an emotionally disturbed person.Casey becomes increasingly aggressive, asking, ""In other words, he's crazy?"" The judge interrupts saying Elliot is not qualified to answer that question. She asks if Picard mentioned Francine to Elliot and if he told him about seeing his sister being gang raped and doing nothing about it. Both times Elliot answers no. Elliot says, ""He never mentioned anything about his sister in my presence."" Picard, now distraught, asks, ""Why? Why should I? Why should I trust God?"" It is unclear whether he thinks Elliot is God. He goes into a rant, believing that Casey is Francine and she is 'testing' him, and has he to be removed from the courtroom. The judge tells Moredock to save his breath, that he is declaring a mistrial and ordering the 730 hearing.As the courtroom clears, Elliot leaves the witness stand and calls to Casey. She hurriedly tries to gather her things and leave, but Elliot confronts her about her questioning. He says she never wanted to try Picard, but she insists she tried this case to the best of her ability. He tells her, ""Cut the crap. You wanted Picard in the loony bin and you used me to put him there."" He turns to storm off, but stumbles over something he didn't see. Olivia steadies him, but he brushes her off, insisting feebly, ""I'm fine.""In her office, Casey says into the phone, ""Yes, sir. I'll be right up."" Olivia barges in angrily asking if she is proud of herself. She tells Olivia she doesn't need a lecture. Olivia says she knows why Casey ""sandbagged Elliot in court,"" and she goes to Casey's desk to take out a picture of Casey with a young man. It is a picture Olivia has seen before when Casey confided in her about her former fiance, Charlie, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Olivia asks if he is locked up now, and says he's the reason Casey ""tanked the Picard case."" She insists that Picard deserves to be punished for what he did. Casey asks if she means what he did to the girls or to Elliot. Olivia accuses her of manipulating the detectives to satisfy her own agenda, and Casey confronts her about informing the FBI that they had Picard in custody asking if she went straight to the FBI or if she went through the Louisiana authorities. Olivia wanted Picard dead and this way her hands were clean. Olivia says the girls were entitled to some justice, but Casey says that what Olivia tried to do isn't justice, but revenge. Olivia says, ""He's my partner, Casey."" Casey says, ""And it's my case. And how I handle it is none of your d--- business because I don't answer to you."" As she leaves, Olivia says quietly, ""We'll see.""In Jack McCoy's office, Casey gets a lecture about how she handled the case and McCoy shows her a police incident report from her past. She explains that Charlie was off his meds and hurt her. When the police came, she identified herself as an ADA and asked them not to charge him. She thought she could help him, but she couldn't. McCoy accuses her of abusing her authority then and abusing it again now. They argue again about how she handled the case and why and he orders her to stay on the case through the 730 hearing and ""behave"" herself. If she doesn't do as she is told, he will not only fire her but have the bar pull her license. Casey goes to the squad room and asks Olivia why she informed McCoy about her past. Olivia says it was because she threw the case. Casey says she had no choice after Olivia informed the feds that Picard was in custody. Olivia stops the argument by saying that she is as guilty as Casey of acting on personal motives and admits she was seeking revenge. Casey asks about Elliot and Olivia says he'll be back to work next week. Olivia asks about Picard. Casey says the judge ruled him incompetent and she couldn't legally touch him now. Olivia asks if she thinks Picard will ever get better, and Casey says she doesn't know. ""I thought Charlie would get better."" When Olivia asks what happened, Casey explains that about six months ago, the morgue called her about a John Doe with her business card in his pocket who had been hit and killed by a taxicab. It was Charlie. She expresses her guilt that maybe Charlie would be alive if she hadn't made him leave and Olivia assures her that she had to take care of herself. Before the conversation can continue, Casey gets a text message. While he was in lockup, Picard made his shirt into a noose and tried to hang himself.In the final scene, Casey goes to visit Picard. This time she invites him to call her Casey. He tells her he isn't crazy; he wants to die. He gets a little better every day and the better he gets, the worse he'll feel about what he did. She suggests that someday he might be able to forgive himself when he realizes it wasn't his fault.""Wasn't it?"" he asks."
